Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresBy Simon StoneBBC SportLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Man UtdManchester United fans have protested against the club's owners, the Glazer Family, who are considering selling up and have invited bidsManchester United owe £969.6m through a combination of gross debt, bank borrowings and outstanding transfer fees with associated payments, according to new figures.The club released their second quarter results to 31 December on Thursday.Unlike previous years, there was no investors' call afterwards as a result of the ongoing "strategic review".This could lead to the sale of the Premier League club.The review itself is centred on how to meet the club's long-term capital investment needs, specifically for improvements to Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training ground, and - it is being stressed - is not due to any issues with short-term liquidity.Nevertheless, the amount owed the club has grown.While the principal debt remains at $650m, a change in the exchange rate meant the club owed £535.7m compared to £477.1m at the same point in the previous year.In addition, £206.2m has been taken from a rolling credit facility, with another £227.7m owed in outstanding transfer fees. The club did have £31m in cash or equivalent, but the overall sum remains just short of £1bn.BBC Sport has been told the figures are evidence of a "stretched" financial situation, although it is being stressed that this has already changed for the better, due to bumper matchday revenues and impressive season ticket sales - and they expect that to continue.Indeed, in posting profits of £6.3m for the quarter, United have also revealed sponsorship revenue has increased 43.2% to £50.4m over the prior quarter. The club said this was due to the impact of their training kit agreement with Tezos, plus a 'one-off sponsorship credit', which they have opted not to detail.Wages were down £20.4m to £77.3m, a decrease of 20.9% as Erik ten Hag's team are not in this season's Champions League.Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsListen to the latest The Devils' Advocate podcastOur coverage of Manchester United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything United - go straight to all the best content

Felix Jones: England recruit ex-Ireland full-back as assistant coachLast updated on 7 hours ago7 hours ago.From the section Rugby UnionFelix Jones joined South Africa as a defence consultant in 2019Former Ireland full-back Felix Jones will leave South Africa's coaching set-up and join England as an assistant coach after the 2023 World Cup.Jones joined the Springboks in 2019 as a defence consultant and helped the side win the 2019 World Cup in Japan.He has continued to be based in the UK, and South Africa director of rugby Rassie Erasmus understands Jones' decision to be closer to his family."It's a big loss to lose a coach of Felix's calibre," said Erasmus. Central contracts a 'good idea' - BrownDupont wins third Six Nations player awardEngland say Felix, who has won 13 Ireland caps and was part of the 2015 Six Nations title-winning squad, will join head coach Steve Borthwick's team after the World Cup finishes in late October.Erasmus added: "While we are saddened by the decision, we know how difficult it was for him to make that call and we fully understand the reasons. "He's been an asset to the Springboks in the last few years and the way he has evolved in his role and willingly took on additional responsibilities to ensure that the team functioned as optimally as possible in his areas of expertise, has been admirable. "We know Felix will remain fully committed to the Springboks' cause and give everything as we attempt to defend our World Cup title in France, and hopefully we can make it a special and memorable send-off for him later this year."Jones also played for Leinster and Munster before being forced to retire at the age of 28 because of a neck injury.He then went straight into the coaching staff at Munster where he worked under Erasmus for the 2016-17 season.After helping Munster to three consecutive European Champions Cup semi-finals, he helped South Africa win the 2019 World Cup and the British and Irish Lions series two years later.

Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLast updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Premier LeagueThe Premier League's new owners' and directors' test rules were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on ThursdayThe Premier League has tightened its ownership rules to block anyone found to have committed human rights abuses from running a club.Human rights abuses, as determined by the UK's Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations, is a new "disqualifying event" in the English top-flight's owners' and directors' test.Individuals subject to UK government sanctions will also be banned.The changes to the test will be applied immediately.The Premier League has also amended the list of criminal offences which would result in disqualification, including those which involve violence, corruption, fraud, tax evasion and hate crimes.It also has new power to stop those wishing to become a director of a club if they are under investigation for conduct that would result in a disqualifying event if it is proven.Human rights group Amnesty International said the move was "a step in the right direction", but warned the Premier League still risked becoming a "sportswashing toy" if the rules were not properly implemented.Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, who was the UK's Sport Minister between 2017 and 2018, said the changes were "smoke and mirrors".English football's new regulator 'can't be a sledgehammer'Premier League 'reviewing ownership test'The Sport Desk podcast: The battle for football's futureThe new rules, which were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, come into force at a time when the ownership of a number of Premier League clubs is under scrutiny.Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim is among the bidders for Manchester United and the prospect of Qatari investment in a Premier League club has raised concerns among human rights and LGBTQ+ groups.The nation's treatment of migrant workers has been criticised, while homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar. Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years and even death by stoning. However, BBC Sport understands Jassim does not believe the strengthened owners' and directors' test will have any impact on his offer to buy the 20-time English champions because he has made the bid as a private individual.Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresEarlier this month, Amnesty said the Premier League "needs to re-examine the assurances" it was given about potential Saudi state control of Newcastle United.Newcastle's takeover by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was approved after the Premier League received "legally binding assurances" the Saudi government would not have any control over the club.Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told a committee of MPs on Tuesday he could not comment on whether his organisation was investigating who has control of Newcastle and whether it was re-examining its approval of the club's Saudi takeover.Last year, Russian businessman Roman Abramovich sold Chelsea after being sanctioned by the UK for his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he denied.Introducing a more stringent owners' and directors' test will be among the powers held by English football's new independent regulator, which was confirmed by a government white paper last month."[The] Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations are already the law of the land so this is nothing new," said Crouch in response to the Premier League's announcement."Improvement always welcome but still don't go as far as white paper."Amnesty UK's economic affairs director Peter Frankental added: "It'll make little difference unless powerful individuals linked to serious human rights violations overseas are definitively barred from taking control of Premier League clubs and using them for state sportswashing."Would, for instance, a future bid involving Saudi or Qatari sovereign wealth funds be blocked by this rule change? It's far from clear that they would."Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment
