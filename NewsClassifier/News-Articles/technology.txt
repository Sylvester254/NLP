Elon Musk among experts urging a halt to AI trainingPublished8 hours agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, AFPImage caption, Elon Musk is among those warning of the risks from advanced AIBy Chris VallanceTechnology reporterKey figures in artificial intelligence want training of powerful AI systems to be suspended amid fears of a threat to humanity.They have signed an open letter warning of potential risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control.Twitter chief Elon Musk is among those who want training of AIs above a certain capacity to be halted for at least six months.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and some researchers at DeepMind also signed.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, recently released GPT-4 - a state-of-the-art technology, which has impressed observers with its ability to do tasks such as answering questions about objects in images.The letter, from Future of Life Institute and signed by the luminaries, wants development to be halted temporarily at that level, warning in their letter of the risks future, more advanced systems might pose."AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity," it says.The Future of Life Institute is a not-for-profit organisation which says its mission is to "steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life".

Outsmarted and obsoleteMore speculatively, the letter asks: "Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete [sic] and replace us?"Stuart Russell, computer-science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a signatory to the letter, told BBC News: "AI systems pose significant risks to democracy through weaponised disinformation, to employment through displacement of human skills and to education through plagiarism and demotivation."And in the future, advanced AI's may pose a "more general threat to human control over our civilization". "In the long run, taking sensible precautions is a small price to pay to mitigate these risks," Prof Russell added.But Princeton computer-science professor Arvind Narayanan accused the letter of focusing on "speculative, futuristic risk, ignoring the version of the problem that is already harming people".'Slow down'In a recent blog post quoted in the letter, OpenAI warned of the risks if an artificial general intelligence (AGI) were developed recklessly: "A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do that, too."Co-ordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important," the firm wrote.OpenAI has not publicly commented on the letter. The BBC has asked the firm whether it backs the call.Mr Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI - though he resigned from the board of the organisation some years ago and has tweeted critically about its current direction. Autonomous driving functions made by his car company Tesla, like most similar systems, use AI technology.The letter asks AI labs "to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4".If such a delay cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium, it says."New and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI" would also be needed. Recently, a number of proposals for the regulation of technology have been put forward in the US, UK and EU. However, the UK has ruled out a dedicated regulator for AI.Related TopicsElon MuskArtificial intelligenceMore on this storyUK rules out new AI regulator1 day agoAI could affect 300 million jobs - report2 days agoBill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decades21 MarchIs the world prepared for the coming AI storm?16 MarchView comments

Elon Musk: Twitter boss announces blue tick shake-upPublished2 days agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesAnnabelle LiangBusiness reporterTwitter boss Elon Musk has announced a shake-up of the social media platform's paid Twitter Blue feature.From 15 April only verified subscribers will have posts recommended to other users and be allowed to vote in polls.Under the policy, posts from non-paying accounts will not be included in the "For you" stream of recommended tweets.Last week, the firm said it would remove the verified status of some "legacy" accounts, which date from before Mr Musk bought the firm.Users currently pay $7 (£5.70) a month for blue-tick verification, which also allows access to additional features.Mr Musk said the changes were "the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over. It is otherwise a hopeless losing battle.""Voting in polls will require verification for same reason," he added.In an earlier post, Mr Musk said paid verification significantly increases the cost of using bots and makes it easier to identify them.Skip twitter post by Elon MuskAllow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a silent threat that no one is seeing," they added.When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he was full of lofty ambitions about bringing back "free speech" .He wanted the platform to be "maximally trusted" and said this "isn't a way to make money".Yet Twitter policy now feels very different to those ideals.Realising that it was difficult to increase advertising revenue, Musk turned to a subscription based model.The sell initially was to give users a "blue tick" verification, if they paid a monthly fee.But the paying users didn't come in their droves. Stuck with flagging advertising revenue, and a stuttering subscription model - Musk has decided to take the nuclear option.There are two algorithms on Twitter - the "For you" stream of recommended tweets and stream of tweets from people you follow.Elon Musk's new policy will now essentially preclude non-paying users from taking part in one of those streams.It means unverified Twitter users will be far less likely to have their tweets liked or retweeted.Combined with Elon Musk's winding down of misinformation checks - this could be an extremely dangerous moment for Twitter.I've spoken to former employees who think this could be manna from heaven for trolls and people pushing misinformation.It also raises an existential question for Twitter. It was supposed to be fairly meritocratic place - with tweets rising by the quality of their content.It was a big part of Twitter's success. But now, that appears to have been swept away.Twitter Blue had a chaotic initial launch in November, as people started impersonating big brands and celebrities and paying for the blue tick badge in order to make them look authentic. Many pretended to be Mr Musk himself.This forced Twitter to pause the feature after less than a week, before it was relaunched the following month.Twitter Blue has since been used by controversial groups, including Taliban officials and their prominent supporters in Afghanistan.Verified users have their tweets amplified above other accounts. Subscribers also have access to additional features including an edit button, among other perks.Previously, the blue tick was used to indicate that high-profile accounts were authentic. It was given out by Twitter without a subscription fee - but only the firm itself decided who got one.Last week, Twitter said it would also start phasing out its "legacy verified programme" and remove some "legacy verified checkmarks" from 1 April.The firm added that users needed to pay to "keep your blue checkmark on Twitter".Bots on social media platforms can hurt their ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions.Mr Musk has often expressed concerns about how many fake or spam accounts are on Twitter. At one point he put his $44bn plan to buy the social media platform on hold as he queried the number of bots disclosed by the firm's previous management team.Related TopicsSocial mediaElon MuskTwitterMore on this storyTwitter says parts of source code leaked online3 days agoMeta exploring plans for Twitter rival10 MarchMusk apologises to Twitter worker over online row8 MarchTaliban start buying blue ticks on Twitter16 JanuaryView comments

Why fun apps are banned on French officials' phonesPublished3 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Shiona McCallumTechnology reporterGovernments and institutions around the world have been banning TikTok from officials' phones and devices, over the past few months.The Netherlands and Norway have joined the list of countries banning the video-sharing app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, from government-issued devices.And despite TikTok's insistence it is independently run and shares no users' data with the Chinese government, France has become the latest country to restrict officials' access to it. But at the same time, it has also become the first country to do the same for all "recreational" apps - including:NetflixInstagramCandy CrushTwitterThe ban, monitored by France's cyber-security agency, will affect about 2.5 million civil servants."Recreational applications do not deliver sufficient levels of cyber-security and data protection to be deployed on administration's digital tools," Civil Service Minister Stanislas Guerini said."These applications may therefore constitute a risk to the data protection of these administrations and their public officials." Although, exceptions could be granted for "institutional communications" purposes.So it looks like France, unlike the rest of the West, is viewing Chinese and American technology companies in a similar way. Although, it is not the first instance of technology tension between the US and France.In 2019, France approved a digital-services tax despite threats of retaliation by the US, who argued it unfairly targeted American technology giants such as Google and Facebook.And since 2018, France has been vocally opposed to the US Cloud Act, which gives American law-enforcement authorities the power to request data stored by most major cloud providers, even if it is outside the US.France has had a prominent voice in the Gaia-X project - set up to:address the conflict between the US Cloud Act and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)set European cloud standards ensure customers' data is stored and processed in Europe, "immune" from non-European lawsDay after day, governments and public bodies are banning TikTok from staff devices - but France's decision to clamp down on all "recreational apps" stands out and is being praised by privacy campaigners.Fears about TikTok have reached fever pitch - but alongside the furore, people are beginning to question the privacy practices of other apps too - regardless of where the companies are based. And this feels like a moment privacy campaigners have been waiting for.Questions are being asked about how data is collected and used by the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and even Candy Crush.The political focus is currently on TikTok because its parent company is in China - but the French government is clearly saying all these social-media companies have questions to answer.Related TopicsFrench politicsTikTokFranceChinaAppsMore on this storyWhat could a TikTok ban mean for creators?7 days agoFive takeaways from TikTok CEO's Congress grilling6 days agoHow a TikTok ban would - or wouldn't - work in practice7 days ago
