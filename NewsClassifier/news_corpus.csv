business,"What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?Published7 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Robert Cuffe & Christine JeavansBBC NewsHouse prices have fallen in recent months, as growing interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, and high inflation has reduced people's spending power. But mortgage interest rates may be stabilising. How might this affect house prices? What is happening to house prices around the UK?Prices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022. But they have fallen by about 4% from that peak according to February's figures from Nationwide. Those recent changes build on very different patterns of growth over the last 15 years. Northern Ireland's house prices have still have not returned to the levels seen before 2008 global financial crisis.In contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015, then saw less growth during the race-for-space period of the pandemic, which saw many people relocate to cheaper areas.

Homeowners who are considering moving may find they have less money to spend. Image source, Getty ImagesAsking prices have not fallen far enough to balance the increased cost of interest rates, so first time buyers are unlikely find buying a house more affordable in the short term. In the longer run, if wages increase faster than house prices recover, housing will become more affordable. Those longer term trends also depend on whether housebuilding keeps up with demand. What has happened to the government's housebuilding target? Will house prices crash?The UK's largest lender, Lloyds, is planning for an 7% fall in 2023. In March, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which advises the government on the health of the economy - predicted that house prices will drop by 10% over the next two years.That would be about half the size of the fall seen during the financial crisis of 2008 and put prices back to where they were in autumn 2021. But predictions are very uncertain.Interest rates may have stabilised. The rates offered for fixed rate mortgage deals have come down from their peak, and experts hope that the rate which sets the cost for trackers or variable rate mortgages may also be at or close to the top. How high could interest rates go? Why are prices rising so much?But interest ratesare still higher than they were a year ago, and and that has affected the market.A small uptick in the number of new mortgages in February did not undo the sharp falls seen at the end of 2022.  About 100,000 households come off a fixed-price mortgage each month. They will be hit by new, higher rates.Some homeowners may find their new monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell, possibly pushing prices down.

Are people struggling to pay their mortgage?The Financial Conduct Authority believes that there are more potentially ""financially stretching"" mortgages in London and the South Eastthan in the rest of the country.Loans in the south tend to be very high compared with borrowers' incomes. This can make the loans difficult to repay when mortgage rates rise or inflation bites. This analysis is one way to look for potential areas of weakness in the market. But it doesn't guarantee that people in these areas will fall behind on their mortgage payments. Most borrowers in recent years have had their ability to pay checked against higher interest rates than the ones we're currently seeing. Lending rules were tightened after the 2008 crash to help ensure people were better prepared for a more difficult economic climate. What happens if I can't afford to pay my mortgage?Fortunately, the number of people behind on their mortgages did not rise significantly in 2022 and was still at half the 2008 level.  The number of repossessions in 2022 was also less than a tenth of what was seen in the years after the crash.  The amount people can spend of their mortgage also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures: on energy bills, wages and job security.And these factors can all change significantly. The future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole, and that picture is also uncertain. Data visualisation by Rob England and Jana Tauschinski.

Salaries are the same but expenses [are] at least double.""A steep rise in the price of essentials was already a drain for Santa, but when her landlord raised monthly rents by nearly two-thirds in June, it was a direct hit. Santa, a 32-year-old social worker and teacher, and her husband live in the tech city of Bengaluru. They both provide for their respective families, while managing their own expenses. Santa is the sole provider for five members of her family and has two jobs in order to earn extra money.Their landlord raised the rent from 7,000 rupees ($86; £70) to Rs11,500 all in one go to compensate for not having put it up during the pandemic, but Santa says this is just bad timing. Prices of perishables and food have almost doubled in the past year. The rapid rate at which prices have risen, especially for food and fuel, is eating into the households' budgets. Even though retail inflation eased to a three-month low in October, that's brought little relief. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Consumer goods sales hit a record high during Diwali, but cheaper products didn't sell as wellNow the family, whose monthly income is Rs20,000, has had to rework its expenses. This means cutting down on all frills and even some essentials. ""My parents love their tea, but for the last one year they must not have had milk tea. I buy dry groceries in limited quantities, only as much as we need, but daily expenses on fresh milk, vegetables, meat has been unmanageable.""As a social worker Santa's job requires her to travel across the city, but bus fares have risen significantly. ""A daily bus pass which used to cost Rs30 earlier, now costs nearly Rs90.""The pandemic had already drained resources for Santa's family leaving them with limited disposable income. ""I have no savings left. I have even pawned my gold jewellery last year when my father was hospitalised.""Covid, followed by the Russia-Ukraine war and the supply chain disruptions made everything expensive. Burdened by this dual blow there has been a perceptible change in consumption patterns in India - particularly among middle and lower income families. The dichotomy in India's economic recovery is apparent. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Internet sales were strong during the festival season in September and OctoberA look at the buoyant stock markets and big companies' strong quarterly profit statements shows the shiny growth story. But a closer look reveals a widening economic disparity. Most consumer goods companies have seen a drop in sales of entry-level or value products - from footwear to mobile phones to biscuits. Expensive brands, however, performed better than the mass market products. Even during the festival season in September and October, when consumer goods sales were at a record high, it was the essentials and high-end products that did the best. Sales of entry-level products across all categories saw a near 10% decline compared with last year. E-commerce in India saw a strong festive season in September and October with sales of nearly Rs755bn, according to a report by market intelligence firm RedSeer. But the finer print shows the average spend per customer has stayed subdued.After two years of Covid lockdowns and quieter festivities, Indians geared up to celebrate the festival of lights in full fervour. Streets were lit up and people decorated their houses with electric lights and earthen lamps. But it seems the celebrations in many households differed from previous years.Consumers did indulge despite the rapid rise in prices, but not everyone joined in - and those who did were choosy.The impact was more pronounced in rural and semi-urban India, home to more than half of the country's huge middle class.Image source, SarikaImage caption, Sarika's food bill has almost doubled in the past yearSarika, a 47-year-old housewife, is one of them. She chose to recycle old dresses for the big annual festival of Diwali in October. While it is a tradition to buy new clothes for the festival, Sarika says the family has been making cuts in almost everything - from clothes to sweets and even basic foodstuffs.Her monthly food bill has almost doubled in the past year. ""From edible oils, to wheat, to cereals, vegetables - all have become costlier by 30-50%. Family expenses have almost doubled in last one year, we cannot afford to buy new clothes for everyone."" What's not rising is Sarika's family income. Her husband's watch shop is seeing fewer customers as they hold on to their old watches for longer or shift to online sales. The family farm suffered crop losses due to unseasonal rainfall: ""I had to prioritise daily needs and paying school and college fees my three children over other necessities,"" she says.Sarika says the excitement surrounding the festival was already low as her son didn't travel from Pune, 150km (93 miles) from Mumbai, for Diwali. Why? Because the bus fares had almost doubled and he saved that money to pay his hostel bills that month.""It hurts the most when you cannot even enjoy the small pleasures of life, just because you do not have enough money.""As the rising cost of living continues to bite and with no relief in sight, families are making hard decisions about their futures too. Santa and her husband, married for three years now, were planning to buy a house in Bengaluru and start a family. But all plans have been shelved for now.

Mr Bailey told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the Bank of England would ""go on being vigilant"".He said we were in a period of ""very heightened, frankly, tension and alertness"".The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the biggest US banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis, and left depositors struggling to get their money out.The collapse was linked to recent rises in interest rates which had hit the value of SVB's assets. US regulators had to step in to protect customers, while the lender's UK arm was rescued by HSBC.Failed lender Silicon Valley Bank bought by rivalBank shares hit as investor nerves returnThe episode has generated heated debate in the US about whether SVB was subject to appropriate supervision and if officials responded properly to its collapse.At a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, financial regulators called the failure ""a textbook case of mismanagement,"" casting blame on SVB leaders for failing to adjust strategies as interest rates rose last year, despite warnings from officials. But they faced questions from senators who said the episode had also revealed failures in oversight.""It looks like regulators knew the problem but nobody dropped the hammer,"" said Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana.UK banking officials admitted to MPs that the speed of the SVB's collapse had taken them by surprise and may mean that banking rules may need updating.Mr Bailey said it was ""the fastest collapse from health to death"" since the UK's Barings Bank failed in 1995 after suffering heavy losses resulting from fraudulent investments.Sam Woods, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, noted that SVB UK saw about a third of its deposits - £3bn - withdrawn on one day.He twice suggested to the MPs that the stress tests applied to UK banks to make sure they can withstand a crisis would need to be looked at, given how new technology meant deposits could be withdrawn electronically in seconds.However, Mr Bailey told MPs he did not think the UK was in a position similar to the 2008 global financial crisis, when banks stopped lending to each other, plunging the world into a deep recession.He added that while rising interest rates were ""an issue"" for US banks, they were less likely to affect UK lenders because they were regulated differently.In the US the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Michael Gruenberg, said the SVB saga had shown the increased risk of bank runs at at a time when ""money can flow out of institutions with incredible speed in response to news amplified through social media channels"". He and other regulators in the US expressed support for strengthening banking rules, changes which some politicians such as Elizabeth Warren have championed.But stricter regulation is opposed by Republicans - reducing the chance of it happening.

technology,"Elon Musk among experts urging a halt to AI trainingPublished8 hours agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, AFPImage caption, Elon Musk is among those warning of the risks from advanced AIBy Chris VallanceTechnology reporterKey figures in artificial intelligence want training of powerful AI systems to be suspended amid fears of a threat to humanity.They have signed an open letter warning of potential risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control.Twitter chief Elon Musk is among those who want training of AIs above a certain capacity to be halted for at least six months.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and some researchers at DeepMind also signed.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, recently released GPT-4 - a state-of-the-art technology, which has impressed observers with its ability to do tasks such as answering questions about objects in images.The letter, from Future of Life Institute and signed by the luminaries, wants development to be halted temporarily at that level, warning in their letter of the risks future, more advanced systems might pose.""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" it says.The Future of Life Institute is a not-for-profit organisation which says its mission is to ""steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life"". This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: What is artificial intelligence?Mr Musk, owner of Twitter and chief executive of car company Tesla, is listed as an external adviser to the organisation.Advanced AIs need to be developed with care, the letter says, but instead, ""recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no-one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control"".The letter warns that AIs could flood information channels with misinformation, and replace jobs with automation.Is the world prepared for the coming AI storm?The letter follows a recent report from investment bank Goldman Sachs which said that while AI was likely to increase productivity, millions of jobs could become automated.However, other experts told the BBC the effect of AI on the labour market was very hard to predict. Outsmarted and obsoleteMore speculatively, the letter asks: ""Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete [sic] and replace us?""Stuart Russell, computer-science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a signatory to the letter, told BBC News: ""AI systems pose significant risks to democracy through weaponised disinformation, to employment through displacement of human skills and to education through plagiarism and demotivation.""And in the future, advanced AI's may pose a ""more general threat to human control over our civilization"". ""In the long run, taking sensible precautions is a small price to pay to mitigate these risks,"" Prof Russell added.But Princeton computer-science professor Arvind Narayanan accused the letter of focusing on ""speculative, futuristic risk, ignoring the version of the problem that is already harming people"".'Slow down'In a recent blog post quoted in the letter, OpenAI warned of the risks if an artificial general intelligence (AGI) were developed recklessly: ""A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do that, too.""Co-ordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important,"" the firm wrote.OpenAI has not publicly commented on the letter. The BBC has asked the firm whether it backs the call.Mr Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI - though he resigned from the board of the organisation some years ago and has tweeted critically about its current direction. Autonomous driving functions made by his car company Tesla, like most similar systems, use AI technology.The letter asks AI labs ""to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4"".If such a delay cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium, it says.""New and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI"" would also be needed. Recently, a number of proposals for the regulation of technology have been put forward in the US, UK and EU. However, the UK has ruled out a dedicated regulator for AI.Related TopicsElon MuskArtificial intelligenceMore on this storyUK rules out new AI regulator1 day agoAI could affect 300 million jobs - report2 days agoBill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decades21 MarchIs the world prepared for the coming AI storm?16 MarchView comments  Elon Musk: Twitter boss announces blue tick shake-upPublished2 days agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesAnnabelle LiangBusiness reporterTwitter boss Elon Musk has announced a shake-up of the social media platform's paid Twitter Blue feature.From 15 April only verified subscribers will have posts recommended to other users and be allowed to vote in polls.Under the policy, posts from non-paying accounts will not be included in the ""For you"" stream of recommended tweets.Last week, the firm said it would remove the verified status of some ""legacy"" accounts, which date from before Mr Musk bought the firm.Users currently pay $7 (£5.70) a month for blue-tick verification, which also allows access to additional features.Mr Musk said the changes were ""the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over. It is otherwise a hopeless losing battle.""""Voting in polls will require verification for same reason,"" he added.In an earlier post, Mr Musk said paid verification significantly increases the cost of using bots and makes it easier to identify them.Skip twitter post by Elon MuskAllow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a silent threat that no one is seeing,"" they added.When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he was full of lofty ambitions about bringing back ""free speech"" .He wanted the platform to be ""maximally trusted"" and said this ""isn't a way to make money"".Yet Twitter policy now feels very different to those ideals.Realising that it was difficult to increase advertising revenue, Musk turned to a subscription based model.The sell initially was to give users a ""blue tick"" verification, if they paid a monthly fee.But the paying users didn't come in their droves. Stuck with flagging advertising revenue, and a stuttering subscription model - Musk has decided to take the nuclear option.There are two algorithms on Twitter - the ""For you"" stream of recommended tweets and stream of tweets from people you follow.Elon Musk's new policy will now essentially preclude non-paying users from taking part in one of those streams.It means unverified Twitter users will be far less likely to have their tweets liked or retweeted.Combined with Elon Musk's winding down of misinformation checks - this could be an extremely dangerous moment for Twitter.I've spoken to former employees who think this could be manna from heaven for trolls and people pushing misinformation.It also raises an existential question for Twitter. It was supposed to be fairly meritocratic place - with tweets rising by the quality of their content.It was a big part of Twitter's success. But now, that appears to have been swept away.Twitter Blue had a chaotic initial launch in November, as people started impersonating big brands and celebrities and paying for the blue tick badge in order to make them look authentic. Many pretended to be Mr Musk himself.This forced Twitter to pause the feature after less than a week, before it was relaunched the following month.Twitter Blue has since been used by controversial groups, including Taliban officials and their prominent supporters in Afghanistan.Verified users have their tweets amplified above other accounts. Subscribers also have access to additional features including an edit button, among other perks.Previously, the blue tick was used to indicate that high-profile accounts were authentic. It was given out by Twitter without a subscription fee - but only the firm itself decided who got one.Last week, Twitter said it would also start phasing out its ""legacy verified programme"" and remove some ""legacy verified checkmarks"" from 1 April.The firm added that users needed to pay to ""keep your blue checkmark on Twitter"".Bots on social media platforms can hurt their ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions.Mr Musk has often expressed concerns about how many fake or spam accounts are on Twitter. At one point he put his $44bn plan to buy the social media platform on hold as he queried the number of bots disclosed by the firm's previous management team.Related TopicsSocial mediaElon MuskTwitterMore on this storyTwitter says parts of source code leaked online3 days agoMeta exploring plans for Twitter rival10 MarchMusk apologises to Twitter worker over online row8 MarchTaliban start buying blue ticks on Twitter16 JanuaryView comments  Why fun apps are banned on French officials' phonesPublished3 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Shiona McCallumTechnology reporterGovernments and institutions around the world have been banning TikTok from officials' phones and devices, over the past few months.The Netherlands and Norway have joined the list of countries banning the video-sharing app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, from government-issued devices.And despite TikTok's insistence it is independently run and shares no users' data with the Chinese government, France has become the latest country to restrict officials' access to it. But at the same time, it has also become the first country to do the same for all ""recreational"" apps - including:NetflixInstagramCandy CrushTwitterThe ban, monitored by France's cyber-security agency, will affect about 2.5 million civil servants.""Recreational applications do not deliver sufficient levels of cyber-security and data protection to be deployed on administration's digital tools,"" Civil Service Minister Stanislas Guerini said.""These applications may therefore constitute a risk to the data protection of these administrations and their public officials."" Although, exceptions could be granted for ""institutional communications"" purposes.So it looks like France, unlike the rest of the West, is viewing Chinese and American technology companies in a similar way. Although, it is not the first instance of technology tension between the US and France.In 2019, France approved a digital-services tax despite threats of retaliation by the US, who argued it unfairly targeted American technology giants such as Google and Facebook.And since 2018, France has been vocally opposed to the US Cloud Act, which gives American law-enforcement authorities the power to request data stored by most major cloud providers, even if it is outside the US.France has had a prominent voice in the Gaia-X project - set up to:address the conflict between the US Cloud Act and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)set European cloud standards ensure customers' data is stored and processed in Europe, ""immune"" from non-European lawsDay after day, governments and public bodies are banning TikTok from staff devices - but France's decision to clamp down on all ""recreational apps"" stands out and is being praised by privacy campaigners.Fears about TikTok have reached fever pitch - but alongside the furore, people are beginning to question the privacy practices of other apps too - regardless of where the companies are based. And this feels like a moment privacy campaigners have been waiting for.Questions are being asked about how data is collected and used by the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and even Candy Crush.The political focus is currently on TikTok because its parent company is in China - but the French government is clearly saying all these social-media companies have questions to answer.Related TopicsFrench politicsTikTokFranceChinaAppsMore on this storyWhat could a TikTok ban mean for creators?7 days agoFive takeaways from TikTok CEO's Congress grilling6 days agoHow a TikTok ban would - or wouldn't - work in practice7 days ago  "
sports,"Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresBy Simon StoneBBC SportLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Man UtdManchester United fans have protested against the club's owners, the Glazer Family, who are considering selling up and have invited bidsManchester United owe £969.6m through a combination of gross debt, bank borrowings and outstanding transfer fees with associated payments, according to new figures.The club released their second quarter results to 31 December on Thursday.Unlike previous years, there was no investors' call afterwards as a result of the ongoing ""strategic review"".This could lead to the sale of the Premier League club.The review itself is centred on how to meet the club's long-term capital investment needs, specifically for improvements to Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training ground, and - it is being stressed - is not due to any issues with short-term liquidity.Nevertheless, the amount owed the club has grown.While the principal debt remains at $650m, a change in the exchange rate meant the club owed £535.7m compared to £477.1m at the same point in the previous year.In addition, £206.2m has been taken from a rolling credit facility, with another £227.7m owed in outstanding transfer fees. The club did have £31m in cash or equivalent, but the overall sum remains just short of £1bn.BBC Sport has been told the figures are evidence of a ""stretched"" financial situation, although it is being stressed that this has already changed for the better, due to bumper matchday revenues and impressive season ticket sales - and they expect that to continue.Indeed, in posting profits of £6.3m for the quarter, United have also revealed sponsorship revenue has increased 43.2% to £50.4m over the prior quarter. The club said this was due to the impact of their training kit agreement with Tezos, plus a 'one-off sponsorship credit', which they have opted not to detail.Wages were down £20.4m to £77.3m, a decrease of 20.9% as Erik ten Hag's team are not in this season's Champions League.Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsListen to the latest The Devils' Advocate podcastOur coverage of Manchester United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything United - go straight to all the best content  Felix Jones: England recruit ex-Ireland full-back as assistant coachLast updated on 7 hours ago7 hours ago.From the section Rugby UnionFelix Jones joined South Africa as a defence consultant in 2019Former Ireland full-back Felix Jones will leave South Africa's coaching set-up and join England as an assistant coach after the 2023 World Cup.Jones joined the Springboks in 2019 as a defence consultant and helped the side win the 2019 World Cup in Japan.He has continued to be based in the UK, and South Africa director of rugby Rassie Erasmus understands Jones' decision to be closer to his family.""It's a big loss to lose a coach of Felix's calibre,"" said Erasmus. Central contracts a 'good idea' - BrownDupont wins third Six Nations player awardEngland say Felix, who has won 13 Ireland caps and was part of the 2015 Six Nations title-winning squad, will join head coach Steve Borthwick's team after the World Cup finishes in late October.Erasmus added: ""While we are saddened by the decision, we know how difficult it was for him to make that call and we fully understand the reasons. ""He's been an asset to the Springboks in the last few years and the way he has evolved in his role and willingly took on additional responsibilities to ensure that the team functioned as optimally as possible in his areas of expertise, has been admirable. ""We know Felix will remain fully committed to the Springboks' cause and give everything as we attempt to defend our World Cup title in France, and hopefully we can make it a special and memorable send-off for him later this year.""Jones also played for Leinster and Munster before being forced to retire at the age of 28 because of a neck injury.He then went straight into the coaching staff at Munster where he worked under Erasmus for the 2016-17 season.After helping Munster to three consecutive European Champions Cup semi-finals, he helped South Africa win the 2019 World Cup and the British and Irish Lions series two years later.  Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLast updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Premier LeagueThe Premier League's new owners' and directors' test rules were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on ThursdayThe Premier League has tightened its ownership rules to block anyone found to have committed human rights abuses from running a club.Human rights abuses, as determined by the UK's Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations, is a new ""disqualifying event"" in the English top-flight's owners' and directors' test.Individuals subject to UK government sanctions will also be banned.The changes to the test will be applied immediately.The Premier League has also amended the list of criminal offences which would result in disqualification, including those which involve violence, corruption, fraud, tax evasion and hate crimes.It also has new power to stop those wishing to become a director of a club if they are under investigation for conduct that would result in a disqualifying event if it is proven.Human rights group Amnesty International said the move was ""a step in the right direction"", but warned the Premier League still risked becoming a ""sportswashing toy"" if the rules were not properly implemented.Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, who was the UK's Sport Minister between 2017 and 2018, said the changes were ""smoke and mirrors"".English football's new regulator 'can't be a sledgehammer'Premier League 'reviewing ownership test'The Sport Desk podcast: The battle for football's futureThe new rules, which were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, come into force at a time when the ownership of a number of Premier League clubs is under scrutiny.Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim is among the bidders for Manchester United and the prospect of Qatari investment in a Premier League club has raised concerns among human rights and LGBTQ+ groups.The nation's treatment of migrant workers has been criticised, while homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar. Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years and even death by stoning. However, BBC Sport understands Jassim does not believe the strengthened owners' and directors' test will have any impact on his offer to buy the 20-time English champions because he has made the bid as a private individual.Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresEarlier this month, Amnesty said the Premier League ""needs to re-examine the assurances"" it was given about potential Saudi state control of Newcastle United.Newcastle's takeover by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was approved after the Premier League received ""legally binding assurances"" the Saudi government would not have any control over the club.Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told a committee of MPs on Tuesday he could not comment on whether his organisation was investigating who has control of Newcastle and whether it was re-examining its approval of the club's Saudi takeover.Last year, Russian businessman Roman Abramovich sold Chelsea after being sanctioned by the UK for his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he denied.Introducing a more stringent owners' and directors' test will be among the powers held by English football's new independent regulator, which was confirmed by a government white paper last month.""[The] Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations are already the law of the land so this is nothing new,"" said Crouch in response to the Premier League's announcement.""Improvement always welcome but still don't go as far as white paper.""Amnesty UK's economic affairs director Peter Frankental added: ""It'll make little difference unless powerful individuals linked to serious human rights violations overseas are definitively barred from taking control of Premier League clubs and using them for state sportswashing.""Would, for instance, a future bid involving Saudi or Qatari sovereign wealth funds be blocked by this rule change? It's far from clear that they would.""Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment  "
