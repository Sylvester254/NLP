Donald Trump indictment: Ex-US president to be charged over hush moneyPublished6 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: The Trump arrest saga in 70 secondsBy Anthony Zurcher & Jude SheerinBBC News, WashingtonFormer US President Donald Trump will be charged over hush money payments made to a porn star just before the 2016 presidential election.The details of the case against him have not yet been released. A grand jury has voted to indict him after investigating a $130,000 pay-out to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to buy her silence over an alleged affair. Mr Trump, 76, denies wrongdoing. He is the first serving or former US president to face a criminal charge.The office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has been pursuing the investigation, confirmed that it had contacted Mr Trump's attorney to "co-ordinate his surrender" on unspecified charges.The ex-president, who lives in Florida, is expected to fly to New York on Monday and be arraigned in court on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The charges in the indictment will be read to him at the hearing, which is set to last about 10-15 minutes.The United States Secret Service - which is tasked with protecting serving and former US presidents - will be in charge of security for the court appearance.Live updates on the indictmentThis is what will happen when Trump is arrestedWhat happened between Stormy Daniels and Trump?In 2016, adult film star Stormy Daniels contacted media outlets offering to sell her account of what she said was an adulterous affair she had with Donald Trump in 2006 - the year after he married his current wife, Melania.Mr Trump's team got wind of this, and his lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to Ms Daniels to keep quiet. This is not illegal.However, when Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer, the record for the payment says it was for legal fees. Prosecutors say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, which is a misdemeanour - a criminal offence - in New York.Prosecutors could also potentially allege that this breaks election law, because his attempt to hide his payments to Ms Daniels were motivated by not wanting voters to know he had an affair with her. Covering up a crime by falsifying records would be a felony, which is a more serious charge. Even advocates for prosecution acknowledge that either way, this is by no means a clear-cut case.There is little precedent for such a prosecution, and past attempts to charge politicians with crossing the line between campaign finance and personal spending have ended in failure.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Trump's 'perp walk' moment explained in 60 secondsMr Trump now faces the prospect of having his fingerprints recorded and his mugshot taken, like all defendants in criminal cases. In a statement, Mr Trump lashed out at the Manhattan district attorney. He called the prosecutor a "disgrace", and accused him of "doing Joe Biden's dirty work"."The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to 'Get Trump,' but now they've done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant Election Interference," he said.Mr Trump has repeatedly slammed the investigation in his hometown of New York as a political "witch hunt" led by his opponents. Mr Bragg, who is a registered Democrat, has denied pursuing a political vendetta against Mr Trump. "We evaluate cases in our jurisdiction based on the facts, the law, and the evidence," he tweeted earlier this month.How big are Trump's legal problems?Profile: The prosecutor in Trump's hush money caseWhat is a US grand jury?Mr Trump's lawyer, Susan Necheles, said in a statement: "He did not commit any crime. We will vigorously fight this political prosecution in court."Following the indictment, Ms Daniels thanked her supporters. "I have so many messages coming in that I can't respond... also don't want to spill my champagne," she tweeted.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Trump denies having an affair with Stormy Daniels (pictured)The criminal case could shape the 2024 presidential race. Mr Trump is currently the front-runner among all declared and potential contenders for the Republican White House nomination.But there is nothing in US law that prevents a candidate who is found guilty of a crime from campaigning for, and serving as, president - even from prison.His campaign sent out fundraising emails on Thursday evening, citing the indictment.Top congressional Republicans are rallying behind Mr Trump.The BBC's Americast team discuss what next for TrumpHouse of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy said: "Alvin Bragg has irreparably damaged our country in an attempt to interfere in our Presidential election."As he routinely frees violent criminals to terrorize the public, he weaponized our sacred system of justice against President Donald Trump."But Democrats welcomed the indictment, arguing it showed no-one was above the law.Congressman Adam Schiff said: "The indictment and arrest of a former president is unique throughout all of American history. "But so too is the unlawful conduct for which Trump has been charged."Mr Trump is also being investigated in several other cases.They include probes into his role in the US Capitol riot of January 2021, his efforts to overturn his loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 election, and his handling of classified documents after leaving office.Mr Trump - who served as president from 2017-21 - was twice impeached by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted by the Senate both times.Related TopicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUnited StatesMore on this storyThe Trump arrest saga in 70 seconds.

Humza Yousaf's first FMQs hit by series of disruptionsPublished15 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Climate change protests disrupt Humza Yousaf's first session of first minister's questionsEleven protesters who disrupted Humza Yousaf's First Minister's Questions (FMQs) debut face a six-month ban from parliament's public gallery. Mr Yousaf's first FMQs session was hit by a series of disruptions from climate activists.The public gallery in the Holyrood chamber was eventually cleared after the session had to be suspended five times in the first 15 minutes. The presiding officer later announced tougher action against the protesters.Police later confirmed that 11 people had been removed from the public gallery but no-one was arrested.Such interruptions have been an almost weekly occurrence during recent FMQs.Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone has pledged to take action to stop them, with mobile phones already having been banned in the gallery. She later said there would be "more stringent measures" to identify those responsible, and a change to the parliament's visitor policy which would ban those individuals from the public gallery for six months. Robison replaces Kate Forbes in new Scottish cabinetWho is Humza Yousaf, Scotland's new first ministerThe first suspension of proceedings came before Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross had even managed to ask his first question to Mr Yousaf, who was sworn in as Nicola Sturgeon's successor as first minister on Wednesday.There were then a series of further interruptions during Mr Ross's exchanges with Mr Yousaf, with the presiding officer eventually calling on police and court officials to remove the public from the gallery.Ms Johnstone said: "I don't think I can adequately express my deep regret that such action is required in our national parliament. "I'm extremely sorry for the overwhelming majority of those who have travelled to the parliament today to watch their elected representatives at work."Image source, PA MediaImage source, Getty ImagesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Police officers cleared the public gallery after a series of interruptionsAfter one group of schoolchildren was allowed to remain in the gallery, SNP MSP Stuart McMillan asked that another school group from his constituency also be allowed to return - prompting a further suspension.Mr Yousaf told the presiding officer he agreed with her decision to clear the gallery, and praised the school pupils for "behaving much better than some of the adults that were in the public gallery". Mr Ross blasted the protesters, saying: "This shower have been doing this week after week, and the image of genuine constituents being forced out of our parliament is one we will all regret and one none of us want to see repeated."He said he was grateful that schoolchildren had been permitted to remain, but added: "We must do something to stop this going forward."Protests have become a regular feature of FMQs in recent months, but today might have been a new record with FIVE inside the first set of questions.Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone told MSPs that there are plans to try to crack down on this.But they chiefly consist of banning the use of mobile phones in the chamber and it is not clear if they will have a decisive effect.Indeed given the protests consist entirely of people shouting, it's difficult to think of a foolproof method to actually prevent them.The public gallery has been cleared for today.The absolute last resort would be to bar people from sitting there at all - something which the parliamentary authorities will be loathe to consider, given that transparent scrutiny is the whole point of Holyrood.The session followed three days of ceremony and procedure since Mr Yousaf's election as SNP leader on Monday. He won the backing of the majority of MSPs to become first minister on Tuesday before being sworn in at the Court of Session on Wednesday. He has named a nine-strong cabinet team, with his new deputy Shona Robison taking over the finance brief from Kate Forbes. Six of the nine cabinet members are women and there are five members under 40.Ms Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in the leadership contest, turned down a move from finance secretary to rural affairs - which would generally be seen as a demotion - and is now sitting as a backbench MSP.Mr Yousaf's appointments came under fire from Mr Ross, who described his team as a "cabinet of lackeys".Mr Ross pointed out that key ministerial posts relating to tourism and social security were abolished while Mr Yousaf had appointed a new minister for independence."It's the same old from the SNP, another nationalist leader, when Scotland needs a national leader," he told the chamber.And he questioned whether having a minister for independence was a priority for the people of Scotland.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Mr Yousaf has been criticised by some within his own party over his choice of cabinet membersMr Yousaf said he made no apology for having a minister focused on independence, saying it was now more important than ever for Scotland to leave the UK.In his question to Mr Yousaf, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar focused on Scotland's mental health crisis, saying that more than 11,000 children and young people waited more than the 18-week standard and over 14,000 had referrals rejected entirely.Mr Yousaf said Mr Sarwar did not acknowledge the global impact of the Covid pandemic, but offered an apology and "deep regret" for anyone who had to wait longer than they should.He added that the Scottish government was taking action on recovery and the number of children starting treatment in the most recent quarter was the highest figure on record.The first minister said the overall mental health treatment waiting lists for young people had decreased by about 777, while the number of children waiting more than 18 weeks had dropped by 1,110.He added that there had been a 41.9% drop in the number waiting more than 52 weeks.Related TopicsScottish ParliamentHumza Yousaf

Margaret Ferrier: MP faces Commons suspension for Covid train tripPublished19 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, PA MediaImage caption, The MP spoke in the House of Commons while awaiting the results of a Covid testMP Margaret Ferrier should be suspended from the Commons for 30 days for breaching Covid rules, the standards committee has recommended.The suspension would likely lead to a by-election in her Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency if imposed.Ferrier spoke in Parliament in September 2020 while awaiting the results of a Covid test.She then took the train home to Glasgow after being told she had tested positive.She lost the SNP whip and has since pleaded guilty to breaching Covid rules. She was sentenced to carry out 270 hours of community service. The charge stated that she had failed to self-isolate and had "exposed people to risk of infection, illness and death".Who is Margaret Ferrier?MP Margaret Ferrier faces Parliament probeMP who exposed public to Covid must do unpaid workCovid MP says she behaved 'out of character'MPs will vote on whether or not to follow the recommendations of the committee - and would generally back its suggested punishment.Any MP suspended from the Commons for at least 10 days can be recalled and a by-election held if at least 10% of the registered voters in their constituency sign a petition calling for it to happen. Labour would have high hopes of winning any by-election in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency. Ferrier had a majority of 5,230 at the last general election when she won it for the SNP, with Labour finishing second. She has been sitting in the Commons as an independent MP since losing the SNP whip. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Daniel Greenberg, began an investigation into her conduct on 12 October following Ferrier's self-referral.He concluded that she had put her own personal interest ahead of the public interest by not immediately self-isolating in London, and had therefore caused "possible risk of harm to health and life for people she came into contact with".The commissioner also said her actions had "caused significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, and of its members generally" and noted that people in many other walks of life would have been sacked for a similar breach of the lockdown rules.'Indication of remorse'Ferrier told the commissioner her self-referral was "an open acceptance" and an "indication of remorse" that she had brought Parliament into disrepute.But she maintains that she did not put her personal interest above that of the public. Glasgow Sheriff Court was told last August that she had taken a Covid test on Saturday 26 September 2020 because she had a "tickly throat".While awaiting her results, she went to church on the Sunday and gave a reading to the congregation, and later spent more than two hours in a bar in Prestwick, Ayrshire.She then travelled to London by train - which had 183 passengers on board - on the Monday and spoke in the Commons later that day before finding out a short time later that she had tested positive for the virus.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Margaret Ferrier campaigning with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon ahead of the 2019 General ElectionFerrier wore a face mask in the Commons, and after speaking in the chamber at about 19:30 had sat at a table with DUP MP Jim Shannon, where they conversed for 20 minutes.The positive result from the test was delivered to her shortly after 20:00, by both text and email.The MP decided to get a train back to Glasgow the following day, fearing she would have to self-isolate in a London hotel room for two weeks.New SNP leader Humza Yousaf called on Ferrier to quit as an MP and said he would look forward to fighting a by-election in her constituency. He added: "We've said from day one that Margaret Ferrier should have stepped down because of her reckless action."We'll take nothing for granted, we won't be complacent. We've got strong support in Rutherglen and right across that region but it will take hard work". Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said said it was right that Parliament had "thrown the book" at Ferrier, and said the SNP still had questions to answer on what they knew and what they did at the time."Ferrier should do the right thing and stand down as an MP. Her constituents deserve better and that means a by-election", he said.The recall process has only been used three times in the past.In the first instance - a petition against DUP MP Ian Paisley in 2018 - the 10% threshold was not met.However, it was met in the other two cases, against Labour MP Fiona Onasanya and Tory Chris Davies in 2019. Ms Onasanya did not contest the by-election in her seat, while Mr Davies stood in the by-election and lost.The rules of the House of Commons mean that if an MP is suspended for 10 sitting days, a recall petition can be opened in their constituency.The petition is open for six weeks, and if 10% of voters in the area sign it, it will trigger a by-election.So there are a few hoops to jump through - the suspension is still to be approved by MPs, and given the ongoing parliamentary proceedings against Boris Johnson there is fierce debate about what sanctions should be applied for Covid rule breaches.Ms Ferrier also has the right to appeal the committee's decision.But it still seems likely there will be a by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West - a seat which has changed hands at the last three general elections.Ms Ferrier won it for the SNP with a majority of 9.7% in 2019, but it was already a key target for Labour.An early contest would be an immediate test for the SNP leader Humza Yousaf - and also for Labour counterparts Sir Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, in their quest to spark a revival in former Scottish heartlands.Related TopicsHouse of CommonsRutherglenMargaret FerrierUK ParliamentMore on this storyWho is Margaret Ferrier?13 September 2022MP Margaret Ferrier faces Parliament probe18 October 2022MP who exposed public to Covid must do unpaid work13 September 2022Covid MP says she behaved 'out of character'11 October 2020

Kate Forbes: SNP leadership candidate leaves governmentPublished2 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Ms Forbes and Mr Yousaf embraced after he was confirmed as Scotland's new first minister on Tuesday afternoonKate Forbes, who finished second in the SNP leadership race, is to leave the Scottish government.The BBC understands the finance secretary was offered a move to rural affairs by the new first minister, Humza Yousaf, but turned down the job. Her departure came hours after the new SNP leader was confirmed as Scotland's first minister after a vote in the Scottish Parliament.The post she was offered by Mr Yousaf would be seen as a major demotion.Ms Forbes later tweeted that Mr Yousaf had her "full support" and said: "I have full confidence he will appoint a talented cabinet and ministerial team, able to meet the challenges facing the country."She had been on maternity leave from her role when Nicola Sturgeon resigned as first minister and SNP leader last month. Profile: Who is Kate Forbes?Yousaf confirmed as Scotland's new first ministerShona Robison to be Scottish deputy first ministerMr Yousaf was elected as first minister after being backed by his own MSPs and the Scottish Greens, which guaranteed him a majority over the opposition party leaders.He becomes Scotland's youngest first minister, at the age of 37, and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Mr Yousaf to congratulate him on Tuesday.Ms Forbes had launched a highly-personal attack on Mr Yousaf during the SNP leadership contest when she questioned whether he was capable of being first minister during a live STV debate. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Humza Yousaf becomes Scottish first ministerShe told Mr Yousaf: "You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times".Ms Forbes came under fire from senior SNP colleagues during the campaign over her socially conservative views on issues like abortion and gay marriage, with Mr Yousaf warning the party against a "lurch to the right". Her beliefs as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland also clash with those of the Scottish Greens, who had threatened to walk away from their power-sharing agreement with the SNP if she had won the contest.Speaking shortly after being confirmed as the new first minister on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Yousaf said he had spoken to Ms Forbes and "absolutely" wanted her to remain in government - but it was not known at that stage what role she had been offered or whether she would accept. Mr Yousaf narrowly defeated Ms Forbes by 26,032 votes to 23,890 to become SNP leader on Monday after a contest that exposed deep divisions within the party. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Humza Yousaf defeated Kate Forbes in the leadership contestThe result was closer than many people expected, and showed that Ms Forbes has considerable support among grassroots SNP members despite Mr Yousaf being backed by the party hierarchy. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice has said Ms Forbes appeared to be more popular than Mr Yousaf with Scottish voters as a whole. Ms Forbes congratulated Mr Yousaf after he was confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday, saying: "Whatever the robust disagreements or frank exchanges of the last few weeks, I am confident we will unite behind Humza as our new party leader in the shared and common objective of independence".The pair also embraced in the Scottish Parliament chamber after the vote that saw him also appointed as the country's sixth first minister.Following the vote, Mr Yousaf announced that Shona Robison - who has been serving as the social justice secretary and was a close ally of Ms Sturgeon - would be appointed as his deputy first minister.Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said Mr Yousaf had "poured petrol on the SNP civil war".Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Nicola Sturgeon tendered her resignation as first minister in a letter to the King"Kate Forbes' furious snub to his offer of a cabinet demotion shows his mission to reunite their feuding party is doomed to failure," he said."It makes a mockery of his claim only yesterday that: 'We are no longer team Humza, or team Ash, or team Kate, we are one team.' The reality is the SNP are divided from top to bottom."In his conversation with the new first minister on Tuesday, the prime minister is said to have reiterated his desire to "continue working constructively with the Scottish government".After his victory, Mr Yousaf promised he would "argue tirelessly for independence"He raised the question of an independence referendum during their call, but Mr Sunak suggested this would "distract" from "delivering on the things that are top of the priority list for people across Scotland".Earlier in the day, Nicola Sturgeon officially tendered her resignation as Scotland's first minister in a letter to the King.This is a big setback for Humza Yousaf's efforts to reunite the SNP after a bruising leadership contest in which Kate Forbes ran him close. On Monday, he appealed for the party to come together as "one team" and to quickly heal the divisions that opened up in the campaign. Today he told me he "absolutely" wanted Kate Forbes in government but within a couple of hours she had turned down his offer to move to rural affairs. That would have been a demotion from finance but those close to Humza Yousaf say it was a genuine offer informed by earlier indications from Kate Forbes. Allies of Kate Forbes say she has had to consider whether or not she could effect real change in Mr Yousaf's government. She will also have weighed up whether serving in his team would help or hinder her prospects should there be another leadership contest in the coming years.Related TopicsKate ForbesHumza Yousaf

The remaining three members of the nine-strong cabinet team are:Mairi Gougeon, who remains the rural affairs secretaryAngus Robertson, who is still the secretary for the constitution, external affairs and cultureShirley-Anne Somerville, who becomes cabinet secretary for social justiceThe full list of 18 non-cabinet ministerial roles was also announced on Wednesday, including a new post of minister for independence, which will be filled by Jamie Hepburn. The co-leaders of the Scottish Greens Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater have been reappointed to the roles they held under Nicola Sturgeon as part of the partnership agreement with the SNP.There is no role in Humza Yousaf's government for defeated SNP leadership candidate Ash Regan. Kate Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in the contest, announced on Tuesday she was leaving the government. She had been offered a new role by Mr Yousaf that would have given her Ms Gougeon's rural affairs job rather than finance - which would generally be viewed as a demotion - but she turned it down.The new cabinet team has five members under the age of 40 and, for the first time, a majority of women.Mr Yousaf said it reflected the priorities that the government will pursue, including tackling child poverty, improving public services and building a fairer, greener economy.He added: "I have committed myself to a radical, ambitious and progressive policy agenda for Scotland - and I know that this team is the right one to deliver it."As we make the case for Scottish independence, we will continue to govern well and demonstrate to the people of Scotland the benefits of decisions about their lives being taken here in Scotland."Mr Yousaf said he wanted a government that looked as much as possible like the people it represented, but insisted that all of his appointments had been made on merit. He also paid tribute to those ministers who are now departing government - including Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney.And he said he was disappointed that Ms Forbes was not in his cabinet as "she's a great talent, she's somebody who has got a lot to give".Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Mairi McAllan joins the cabinet for the first time, at the age of 30During the SNP leadership campaign, Mr Yousaf said he favoured a "big tent" rather than "inner circle" approach to making key decisions and has pledged to bring the party back together again after deep divisions were exposed by the contest.He faced withering criticism of his own ministerial record from Ms Forbes in a live STV debate, while her views on issues such as gender recognition reform and gay marriage led the Scottish Greens to question whether they could work with her.Given the narrow margin of his victory over Ms Forbes, by 52.1% to 47.9%, some of her supporters had urged Mr Yousaf to keep her in government.  BBC Scotland understands that Ms Forbes felt the SNP's partnership agreement with the Scottish Greens would have "tied her hands and cost her dearly in her constituency" if she had taken the rural affairs job.It emerged earlier on Wednesday that Ivan McKee, who had been the business minister under Nicola Sturgeon, will also leave the government after being offered a new role that he regarded as a demotion. Mr McKee had initially been campaign manager for Ms Forbes in the leadership contest, but stepped back from that role after early controversies in her campaign.Humza Yousaf has opted for a balance of youth and experience in his cabinet.This is underlined by the way he has split the finance portfolio between his deputy Shona Robison - an MSP since 1999 and a veteran of several government posts - and a fresher face in Neil Gray, who takes on the economy brief.Angela Constance and Michael Matheson both know their way around government, and have been handed two of the trickier jobs in justice and health.But perhaps the stiffest task has been reserved for cabinet newbie Jenny Gilruth, the former teacher who must now attempt to close the attainment gap - a task which eluded a succession of education secretaries including John Swinney.There are one or two glaring absences though.Keith Brown is out as justice secretary, two years after returning to government. He will presumably go back to focusing on his post as deputy leader of the SNP, with big changes in the offing at party HQ.And the absence of Kate Forbes may make it harder for Mr Yousaf to pull the party back together, given how close she ran him in the leadership contest.Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie described the new cabinet team as "dismal" and said it "cements the SNP's new status as a deeply divided party led by B-rate politicians".She added: "The first minister promised to bring the country together, but he can't even bring his own party together. Loyalty is being rewarded over talent - but both are in short supply in the SNP. "At the heart of this continuity government are some of the most incompetent politicians of the last decade, set to deliver more of the same failure."Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: "This is a cabinet in Humza Yousaf's image - failed, continuity ministers appointed by a failed, continuity minister. "The likes of Shona Robison, Michael Matheson, Angela Constance and Jenny Gilruth have been found sorely wanting in previous ministerial roles, yet all have been 'rewarded' with promotion by the new first minister."Related TopicsScottish governmentSNP leadership contest 2023SNP (Scottish National Party)Humza Yousaf
