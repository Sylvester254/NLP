What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?Published7 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Robert Cuffe & Christine JeavansBBC NewsHouse prices have fallen in recent months, as growing interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, and high inflation has reduced people's spending power. But mortgage interest rates may be stabilising. How might this affect house prices? What is happening to house prices around the UK?Prices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022. But they have fallen by about 4% from that peak according to February's figures from Nationwide. Those recent changes build on very different patterns of growth over the last 15 years. Northern Ireland's house prices have still have not returned to the levels seen before 2008 global financial crisis.In contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015, then saw less growth during the race-for-space period of the pandemic, which saw many people relocate to cheaper areas.

What happens when house prices fall?The biggest immediate effect is on people who want to move.Some sellers may delay putting their homes on the market. Homeowners who are considering moving may find they have less money to spend. Image source, Getty ImagesAsking prices have not fallen far enough to balance the increased cost of interest rates, so first time buyers are unlikely find buying a house more affordable in the short term. In the longer run, if wages increase faster than house prices recover, housing will become more affordable. Those longer term trends also depend on whether housebuilding keeps up with demand. What has happened to the government's housebuilding target? Will house prices crash?The UK's largest lender, Lloyds, is planning for an 7% fall in 2023. In March, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which advises the government on the health of the economy - predicted that house prices will drop by 10% over the next two years.That would be about half the size of the fall seen during the financial crisis of 2008 and put prices back to where they were in autumn 2021. But predictions are very uncertain.Interest rates may have stabilised. The rates offered for fixed rate mortgage deals have come down from their peak, and experts hope that the rate which sets the cost for trackers or variable rate mortgages may also be at or close to the top. How high could interest rates go? Why are prices rising so much?But interest ratesare still higher than they were a year ago, and and that has affected the market.A small uptick in the number of new mortgages in February did not undo the sharp falls seen at the end of 2022.  About 100,000 households come off a fixed-price mortgage each month. They will be hit by new, higher rates.Some homeowners may find their new monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell, possibly pushing prices down.

Are people struggling to pay their mortgage?The Financial Conduct Authority believes that there are more potentially "financially stretching" mortgages in London and the South Eastthan in the rest of the country.Loans in the south tend to be very high compared with borrowers' incomes. This can make the loans difficult to repay when mortgage rates rise or inflation bites. This analysis is one way to look for potential areas of weakness in the market. But it doesn't guarantee that people in these areas will fall behind on their mortgage payments. Most borrowers in recent years have had their ability to pay checked against higher interest rates than the ones we're currently seeing. Lending rules were tightened after the 2008 crash to help ensure people were better prepared for a more difficult economic climate. What happens if I can't afford to pay my mortgage?Fortunately, the number of people behind on their mortgages did not rise significantly in 2022 and was still at half the 2008 level.  The number of repossessions in 2022 was also less than a tenth of what was seen in the years after the crash.  The amount people can spend of their mortgage also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures: on energy bills, wages and job security.And these factors can all change significantly. The future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole, and that picture is also uncertain. Data visualisation by Rob England and Jana Tauschinski.

India's middle class hit by rising cost of livingPublished14 December 2022Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The rapid rise in the price of food and fuel in India is hitting household budgetsBy Archana ShuklaBBC Business Correspondent"We are really surviving on a day to day basis. Salaries are the same but expenses [are] at least double."A steep rise in the price of essentials was already a drain for Santa, but when her landlord raised monthly rents by nearly two-thirds in June, it was a direct hit. Santa, a 32-year-old social worker and teacher, and her husband live in the tech city of Bengaluru. They both provide for their respective families, while managing their own expenses. Santa is the sole provider for five members of her family and has two jobs in order to earn extra money.Their landlord raised the rent from 7,000 rupees ($86; £70) to Rs11,500 all in one go to compensate for not having put it up during the pandemic, but Santa says this is just bad timing. Prices of perishables and food have almost doubled in the past year. The rapid rate at which prices have risen, especially for food and fuel, is eating into the households' budgets. Even though retail inflation eased to a three-month low in October, that's brought little relief. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Consumer goods sales hit a record high during Diwali, but cheaper products didn't sell as wellNow the family, whose monthly income is Rs20,000, has had to rework its expenses. This means cutting down on all frills and even some essentials. "My parents love their tea, but for the last one year they must not have had milk tea. I buy dry groceries in limited quantities, only as much as we need, but daily expenses on fresh milk, vegetables, meat has been unmanageable."As a social worker Santa's job requires her to travel across the city, but bus fares have risen significantly. "A daily bus pass which used to cost Rs30 earlier, now costs nearly Rs90."The pandemic had already drained resources for Santa's family leaving them with limited disposable income. "I have no savings left. I have even pawned my gold jewellery last year when my father was hospitalised."Covid, followed by the Russia-Ukraine war and the supply chain disruptions made everything expensive. Burdened by this dual blow there has been a perceptible change in consumption patterns in India - particularly among middle and lower income families. The dichotomy in India's economic recovery is apparent. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Internet sales were strong during the festival season in September and OctoberA look at the buoyant stock markets and big companies' strong quarterly profit statements shows the shiny growth story. But a closer look reveals a widening economic disparity. Most consumer goods companies have seen a drop in sales of entry-level or value products - from footwear to mobile phones to biscuits. Expensive brands, however, performed better than the mass market products. Even during the festival season in September and October, when consumer goods sales were at a record high, it was the essentials and high-end products that did the best. Sales of entry-level products across all categories saw a near 10% decline compared with last year. E-commerce in India saw a strong festive season in September and October with sales of nearly Rs755bn, according to a report by market intelligence firm RedSeer. But the finer print shows the average spend per customer has stayed subdued.After two years of Covid lockdowns and quieter festivities, Indians geared up to celebrate the festival of lights in full fervour. Streets were lit up and people decorated their houses with electric lights and earthen lamps. But it seems the celebrations in many households differed from previous years.Consumers did indulge despite the rapid rise in prices, but not everyone joined in - and those who did were choosy.The impact was more pronounced in rural and semi-urban India, home to more than half of the country's huge middle class.Image source, SarikaImage caption, Sarika's food bill has almost doubled in the past yearSarika, a 47-year-old housewife, is one of them. She chose to recycle old dresses for the big annual festival of Diwali in October. While it is a tradition to buy new clothes for the festival, Sarika says the family has been making cuts in almost everything - from clothes to sweets and even basic foodstuffs.Her monthly food bill has almost doubled in the past year. "From edible oils, to wheat, to cereals, vegetables - all have become costlier by 30-50%. Family expenses have almost doubled in last one year, we cannot afford to buy new clothes for everyone." What's not rising is Sarika's family income. Her husband's watch shop is seeing fewer customers as they hold on to their old watches for longer or shift to online sales. The family farm suffered crop losses due to unseasonal rainfall: "I had to prioritise daily needs and paying school and college fees my three children over other necessities," she says.Sarika says the excitement surrounding the festival was already low as her son didn't travel from Pune, 150km (93 miles) from Mumbai, for Diwali. Why? Because the bus fares had almost doubled and he saved that money to pay his hostel bills that month."It hurts the most when you cannot even enjoy the small pleasures of life, just because you do not have enough money."As the rising cost of living continues to bite and with no relief in sight, families are making hard decisions about their futures too. Santa and her husband, married for three years now, were planning to buy a house in Bengaluru and start a family. But all plans have been shelved for now.

Bank of England on heightened alert for further banking turmoilPublished2 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesThe Bank of England is on "heightened" alert for further turmoil in the banking sector, its governor has said.However, Andrew Bailey told MPs the recent problems facing lenders had not caused stress in the UK banking system.Officials have tried to calm investors since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed, sparking concerns about the stability of other lenders.In Europe, worries over the strength of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse led to a rushed takeover by rival UBS.Nerves among investors have sparked sharp falls in banking shares around the world. Mr Bailey told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the Bank of England would "go on being vigilant".He said we were in a period of "very heightened, frankly, tension and alertness".The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the biggest US banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis, and left depositors struggling to get their money out.The collapse was linked to recent rises in interest rates which had hit the value of SVB's assets. US regulators had to step in to protect customers, while the lender's UK arm was rescued by HSBC.Failed lender Silicon Valley Bank bought by rivalBank shares hit as investor nerves returnThe episode has generated heated debate in the US about whether SVB was subject to appropriate supervision and if officials responded properly to its collapse.At a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, financial regulators called the failure "a textbook case of mismanagement," casting blame on SVB leaders for failing to adjust strategies as interest rates rose last year, despite warnings from officials. But they faced questions from senators who said the episode had also revealed failures in oversight."It looks like regulators knew the problem but nobody dropped the hammer," said Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana.UK banking officials admitted to MPs that the speed of the SVB's collapse had taken them by surprise and may mean that banking rules may need updating.Mr Bailey said it was "the fastest collapse from health to death" since the UK's Barings Bank failed in 1995 after suffering heavy losses resulting from fraudulent investments.Sam Woods, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, noted that SVB UK saw about a third of its deposits - £3bn - withdrawn on one day.He twice suggested to the MPs that the stress tests applied to UK banks to make sure they can withstand a crisis would need to be looked at, given how new technology meant deposits could be withdrawn electronically in seconds.However, Mr Bailey told MPs he did not think the UK was in a position similar to the 2008 global financial crisis, when banks stopped lending to each other, plunging the world into a deep recession.He added that while rising interest rates were "an issue" for US banks, they were less likely to affect UK lenders because they were regulated differently.In the US the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Michael Gruenberg, said the SVB saga had shown the increased risk of bank runs at at a time when "money can flow out of institutions with incredible speed in response to news amplified through social media channels". He and other regulators in the US expressed support for strengthening banking rules, changes which some politicians such as Elizabeth Warren have championed.But stricter regulation is opposed by Republicans - reducing the chance of it happening.

The tech helping driverless cars see round cornersPublished3 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, ServCity driverless car projectBy Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News"A bit like X-ray vision" is how engineer James Long describes the effect of the technology he's working on.Sitting in front of a bank of TV screens showing busy London streets, he's explaining to me how a network of roadside cameras is helping a self-driving car to navigate heavy traffic.The cameras are used to help the car identify potential hazards in advance, before they can be picked up by its own sensors. This allows it to anticipate problems, and progress more smoothly through traffic.The system has been on trial on the roads of Woolwich, in south-east London, as part of the ServCity project which aims to refine autonomous technologies for busy city streets. The scheme, which has been operating for three years, is run by a consortium including Nissan, Hitachi Europe, the Transport Research Laboratory and the University of Nottingham, among others. It is now coming to an end. Image source, NissanImage caption, The Nissan Leaf is equipped with multiple sensorsThe project uses Nissan's electric Leaf model. Each car is festooned with cameras and sensors, many of them bolted to a perfectly ordinary roof rack. The boot is full of computers and electronics. It all looks rather rough and ready.But out on the road, following a circuit between roundabouts on the A206, it feels smooth and controlled. Sitting in the back seat, it's remarkably easy to forget the car is guiding itself.Such precision is helped by guidance systems using precise 3D mapping, highly accurate GPS, radar, and Lidar - a laser-based sensing method.Over the past three years, ServCity's cars have racked up some 1,600 miles of autonomous driving, without a serious incident - though on every outing a safety driver has been in position to take control if necessary.It is an impressive record. The roads of Woolwich are busy and unpredictable. Buses dice with taxis, delivery drivers stop without warning, and cyclists weave through heavy traffic."What we're actually trying to do is expand the boundaries of autonomous drive," explains David Moss, Nissan's senior vice president for research and development in the UK and Europe. "So we want to be able to improve not just the ability to drive on the highway, but also to take on complex environments in the city."Trials of self-driving vehicles are nothing new. There are even commercial services using them as taxis, on a strictly controlled basis, in some cities in the US, China and South Korea.Image source, NissanImage caption, The ServCity car used information from roadside camerasThis project, however, has focused specifically on finding ways for the car to use roadside infrastructure, such as traffic cameras, to improve its awareness - and allow it to drive more smoothly.This is where the technology being overseen by James Long comes in. He is the head of technical consulting at the Smart Mobility Living Lab, which was set up with the help of government funding to create a test-bed for connected and self-driving technology in London."What we've been looking at particularly is things like parked vehicles and buses in bus stops that are beyond the line of sight," he says."So we've been using our roadside cameras and infrastructure to be able to see those situations - a bit like X-ray vision - beyond the line of sight in such a way that the information can be transmitted to the vehicle."Ultimately, this kind of technology could be used to build a kind of ecosystem in which cars do not rely on their own sensors, but take in a wide array of information from communicating with their surroundings, and indeed with one another.In theory, that should reduce congestion.Image source, NissanImage caption, Some experts say driverless cars will have to connect to road infrastructure"I really applaud this approach," says Sven Beiker, founder of the Silicon Valley Mobility consultancy, and a former head of the Center for Automotive research at Stanford University."We need this connection between the automated, self-driving, autonomous vehicle and a centralised infrastructure and potentially to other vehicles as well."I do not think you can have a self-driving car without some sort of connection to road infrastructure."But although the ServCity trial is clearly impressive, Mr Beiker thinks it will be years before use of self-driving cars in cities becomes widespread, because of the need to prepare infrastructure and develop high-definition 3D maps in every area they are to be used.

UK-Asia trade deal to boost UK economy by 0.08%Published1 hour agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsBrexitImage source, Getty ImagesBy Tom EspinerBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe UK has signed a deal to join a trade pact with 11 Asia and Pacific nations, three years after it officially left the European Union.Joining the group will boost UK exports by cutting tariffs on goods such as cheese, cars, chocolate, machinery, gin and whisky, the government said.However, the government's own estimates show being in the bloc will only add 0.08% to the size of the UK's economy.The trade area covers a market of around 500 million people.The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership - or CPTPP - was established in 2018, and includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.Membership of the CPTPP loosens restrictions on trade between members and reduce tariffs - a form of border tax - on goods.UK to join Asia's trade club - what is the CPTPP?Together, the 11 members account for about 13% of the world's income and after 21 months of negotiations, the UK has become the first European country to join.The government said the agreement was the UK's "biggest trade deal since Brexit". However, the gains for the UK from joining are expected to be modest. The UK already has free trade deals with all of the members except Brunei and Malaysia, some of which were rolled over from its previous membership of the EU.And even with some gains in trading the government only estimates it will add 0.08% to the size of the economy in 10 years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides forecasts for the government, has previously said Brexit would reduce the UK's potential economic growth by about 4% in the long term.'Prime position'But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal demonstrated the "real economic benefits of our post-Brexit freedoms"."As part of CPTPP, the UK is now in a prime position in the global economy to seize opportunities for new jobs, growth and innovation," he said."British businesses will now enjoy unparalleled access to markets from Europe to the south Pacific."Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said the agreement was like "buying a start-up"."This is not to replace EU trade, this is in addition. We are still in a free trade agreement with the EU," she told Radio 4's Today programme."You wouldn't buy a small company like that and expect it to be delivering on the day - we are thinking about the potential," she said, adding that in seven years "40% of the world's middle class is going to come from that region".Ms Badenoch denied there would be any hit to UK agriculture, saying the deal would "create new markets" for farmers.Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the UK joining the CPTPP was "encouraging", but added that questions remain on "consumer safety, food safety, data protection and environmental protections".The government said other "benefits" of being in the bloc included, a boost to the services sector, by UK firms not being required to establish a local office or be resident to supply a service, meaning they will be on a par with local firms. The government said it and CPTPP members would make the final legal and administrative steps required for the UK to formally sign in 2023. Related TopicsUK trade tariffsUK economyBrexitTradeMore on this storyUK agrees to join Asia's trade club - but what is it?6 hours agoUK signs free trade deal with Australia17 December 2021UK agrees free trade deal with New Zealand20 October 2021View comments

Why is the UK economy lagging behind the US, Germany and others?Published18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsBrexitImage source, Getty ImagesBy Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe UK economy is struggling - and people are feeling it in their pockets, as wages fail to keep up with rising prices.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK economy will shrink this year while every other major economy will grow. The Bank of England also forecasts a recession in the UK in 2023 - albeit one that is shorter and less severe than previously forecast.Perhaps it's not surprising the outlook is bleak given the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and soaring costs of both energy and food.But why is the UK seemingly faring worse than other rich countries such as the US, Germany and France?Is the UK really lagging behind?Forecasts are never perfect. There are so many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather - that, inevitably, predictions often miss the mark. But they can point in the right direction.And the existing evidence shows other countries have taken less of a hit from the huge challenges of recent years than the UK has.Figures from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which looks at how rich countries are performing, show the UK economy fell further than others in the first months of the pandemic. The UK's pace of recovery was fast once the economy reopened - but not fast enough to make up the lost ground. But the difference between the UK and others may not be quite as big as it appears.That's because most countries measure the output of their public services, such as health and education, based on the costs - a nurse's wage, for example. In the UK they are accounted for differently, by valuing the services delivered - such as operations in hospital.As a result, the UK's figures better reflect the impact of closed schools and cancelled operations during Covid, as well as disruption due to strikes.The bigger picture, however, remains: the Bank of England and the IMF both expect the UK economy to shrink this year, while other G7 countries are expected to grow.Some observers, including pro-Brexit economist Julian Jessop, believe the IMF was overly gloomy about the UK's prospects and that the differences under discussion - a percentage point here or there - are small.Nevertheless, he says, there is still definitely "something to explain" about the UK's flagging economic performance.Is it all down to Brexit?Estimates about the cost of Brexit vary - according to a report by Bloomberg it is costing the UK economy roughly £100bn a year, and the economy is 4% smaller than it might have been if the UK had stayed in the EU."The EU is a very rich part of the world," says Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think tank. "And we've chosen, for better or worse, to make trade with that grouping of countries a lot more difficult, so it's clearly going to be something that makes it harder for the UK economy to grow."What impact has Brexit had on the UK economy?Business investment has stagnated since the referendum vote in 2016 too, he says - another "drag on growth". A Bank of England policymaker has said that Brexit hit UK investment to the tune of £29bn.EU workers used to come freely to work in the UK but can no longer do so, making it hard for the hospitality, agriculture, and care sectors to find enough staff. Julian Jessop is a fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs and describes himself as a "Brexit optimist". He believes there are big potential gains from leaving the EU, but agrees there have been short-term economic costs."We're still in a sort of transition phase, where the negatives are dominating," he says. But he says those negatives are "smaller than people have been arguing" and "more likely to be temporary, because a lot of them have to do with uncertainty and the process of adjustment".What else is affecting the economy?Energy costs Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent global energy prices soaring - but the impact varies between countries.The US has its own domestic sources of fossil fuels and some European countries have more alternative sources of energy, Mr Emmerson says. France, for example, has a large nuclear network, and Norway has significant hydropower. "Britain is pretty exposed," he says.Moreover, the way the UK prices electricity is based on the cost of gas, the most expensive form of electricity generation. That has pushed up bills across the economy and made inflation worse, Mr Jessop says.Workforce shortagesMost economies saw their workforce shrink during the pandemic.But again, the UK is an outlier, with numbers failing to bounce back after the crisis. Economists are still trying to work out why. It seems it is not just down to having fewer EU workers. Young people have opted to study rather than work, older people have retired early, and more people are receiving long-term sickness benefits. Who are the millions of Britons not working?More 16-24-year-olds get jobs as living costs biteThere are signs the workforce is starting to grow again, which could help boost growth and tax revenues later this year.Long-term problemsThere are also more fundamental reasons behind the UK's weaker performance, suggests Cambridge University economist Diane Coyle.While the economy has slowed since the financial crisis in 2008, the roots of the problems go back much further, she argues, with investment in decline since the 1990s.That left the economy lacking the resilience to cope with the triple shocks of Covid, Brexit and the war in Ukraine."That's down to the long-term weaknesses, long-term under investment, in the private and the public sector, [and] degradation of public services and infrastructure, which are just essential if the economy is going to grow," she says.For its part, the government says the UK economy is resilient. Responding to figures showing that the UK narrowly avoided a recession in 2022, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the numbers showed "underlying resilience" - but added the country was "not out of the woods".Related TopicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsEconomic growthBrexitMore on this storyUK not out of woods as it avoids recession - Hunt10 FebruaryWhat impact has Brexit had on the UK economy?31 JanuaryMore 16-24-year-olds get jobs as living costs bite14 FebruaryWho are the millions of Britons not working?15 MarchHow much should we care what the IMF thinks?31 JanuaryWhat is GDP and how does it affect me?2 hours ago
