Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresBy Simon StoneBBC SportLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Man UtdManchester United fans have protested against the club's owners, the Glazer Family, who are considering selling up and have invited bidsManchester United owe £969.6m through a combination of gross debt, bank borrowings and outstanding transfer fees with associated payments, according to new figures.The club released their second quarter results to 31 December on Thursday.Unlike previous years, there was no investors' call afterwards as a result of the ongoing "strategic review".This could lead to the sale of the Premier League club.The review itself is centred on how to meet the club's long-term capital investment needs, specifically for improvements to Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training ground, and - it is being stressed - is not due to any issues with short-term liquidity.Nevertheless, the amount owed the club has grown.While the principal debt remains at $650m, a change in the exchange rate meant the club owed £535.7m compared to £477.1m at the same point in the previous year.In addition, £206.2m has been taken from a rolling credit facility, with another £227.7m owed in outstanding transfer fees. The club did have £31m in cash or equivalent, but the overall sum remains just short of £1bn.BBC Sport has been told the figures are evidence of a "stretched" financial situation, although it is being stressed that this has already changed for the better, due to bumper matchday revenues and impressive season ticket sales - and they expect that to continue.Indeed, in posting profits of £6.3m for the quarter, United have also revealed sponsorship revenue has increased 43.2% to £50.4m over the prior quarter. The club said this was due to the impact of their training kit agreement with Tezos, plus a 'one-off sponsorship credit', which they have opted not to detail.Wages were down £20.4m to £77.3m, a decrease of 20.9% as Erik ten Hag's team are not in this season's Champions League.Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsListen to the latest The Devils' Advocate podcastOur coverage of Manchester United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything United - go straight to all the best content

Felix Jones: England recruit ex-Ireland full-back as assistant coachLast updated on 7 hours ago7 hours ago.From the section Rugby UnionFelix Jones joined South Africa as a defence consultant in 2019Former Ireland full-back Felix Jones will leave South Africa's coaching set-up and join England as an assistant coach after the 2023 World Cup.Jones joined the Springboks in 2019 as a defence consultant and helped the side win the 2019 World Cup in Japan.He has continued to be based in the UK, and South Africa director of rugby Rassie Erasmus understands Jones' decision to be closer to his family."It's a big loss to lose a coach of Felix's calibre," said Erasmus.

"He's been an asset to the Springboks in the last few years and the way he has evolved in his role and willingly took on additional responsibilities to ensure that the team functioned as optimally as possible in his areas of expertise, has been admirable. "We know Felix will remain fully committed to the Springboks' cause and give everything as we attempt to defend our World Cup title in France, and hopefully we can make it a special and memorable send-off for him later this year."Jones also played for Leinster and Munster before being forced to retire at the age of 28 because of a neck injury.He then went straight into the coaching staff at Munster where he worked under Erasmus for the 2016-17 season.After helping Munster to three consecutive European Champions Cup semi-finals, he helped South Africa win the 2019 World Cup and the British and Irish Lions series two years later.

Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLast updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Premier LeagueThe Premier League's new owners' and directors' test rules were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on ThursdayThe Premier League has tightened its ownership rules to block anyone found to have committed human rights abuses from running a club.Human rights abuses, as determined by the UK's Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations, is a new "disqualifying event" in the English top-flight's owners' and directors' test.Individuals subject to UK government sanctions will also be banned.The changes to the test will be applied immediately.The Premier League has also amended the list of criminal offences which would result in disqualification, including those which involve violence, corruption, fraud, tax evasion and hate crimes.It also has new power to stop those wishing to become a director of a club if they are under investigation for conduct that would result in a disqualifying event if it is proven.Human rights group Amnesty International said the move was "a step in the right direction", but warned the Premier League still risked becoming a "sportswashing toy" if the rules were not properly implemented.Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, who was the UK's Sport Minister between 2017 and 2018, said the changes were "smoke and mirrors".English football's new regulator 'can't be a sledgehammer'Premier League 'reviewing ownership test'The Sport Desk podcast: The battle for football's futureThe new rules, which were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, come into force at a time when the ownership of a number of Premier League clubs is under scrutiny.Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim is among the bidders for Manchester United and the prospect of Qatari investment in a Premier League club has raised concerns among human rights and LGBTQ+ groups.The nation's treatment of migrant workers has been criticised, while homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar. Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years and even death by stoning. However, BBC Sport understands Jassim does not believe the strengthened owners' and directors' test will have any impact on his offer to buy the 20-time English champions because he has made the bid as a private individual.Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresEarlier this month, Amnesty said the Premier League "needs to re-examine the assurances" it was given about potential Saudi state control of Newcastle United.Newcastle's takeover by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was approved after the Premier League received "legally binding assurances" the Saudi government would not have any control over the club.Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told a committee of MPs on Tuesday he could not comment on whether his organisation was investigating who has control of Newcastle and whether it was re-examining its approval of the club's Saudi takeover.Last year, Russian businessman Roman Abramovich sold Chelsea after being sanctioned by the UK for his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he denied.Introducing a more stringent owners' and directors' test will be among the powers held by English football's new independent regulator, which was confirmed by a government white paper last month."[The] Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations are already the law of the land so this is nothing new," said Crouch in response to the Premier League's announcement."Improvement always welcome but still don't go as far as white paper."Amnesty UK's economic affairs director Peter Frankental added: "It'll make little difference unless powerful individuals linked to serious human rights violations overseas are definitively barred from taking control of Premier League clubs and using them for state sportswashing."Would, for instance, a future bid involving Saudi or Qatari sovereign wealth funds be blocked by this rule change?

Man City v Liverpool: Danny Murphy on Jurgen Klopp's huge eight daysBy Danny MurphyFormer Liverpool midfielderLast updated on 5 hours ago5 hours ago.From the section LiverpoolThis is going to be a monumental week for Liverpool, but the fact they face three huge tests in quick succession might actually be exactly what they need.Starting on Saturday, the Reds play Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal in the space of eight days and I think they need to win at least two of those games to stay in the fight for the top four.That looks like a daunting prospect - but it might surprise a few people to see that Liverpool have not just done well in these big games this season, they've done better than any of the other top teams.When you include the top six's results against Champions League quarter-finalists Chelsea, Liverpool are still top of their mini-league, on goal difference. They drew at Anfield in January, while City and Arsenal have both beaten the BluesTo see Jurgen Klopp's side top of this mini-table did not shock me, though - it actually backs up my theory about their struggles this season, and why they have not got close to mounting a title challenge.At the start of the campaign, it felt like Liverpool had a little bit of a hangover from missing out on two of the big trophies last May. That was understandable, because they were two games from greatness last season. They were one Premier League win and the Champions League final away from a quadruple and doing what no team had done before in English football.More of a concern for me back in August was that a lot of the Liverpool players did not have real competition for their places. Watching their early performances, I felt complacency set in a little bit, especially against the lesser teams.Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier used to talk to me about it a lot when he was in charge at Anfield, when he would always warn us about what he called the comfort zone.He'd say that's what players fall into when they start believing their own hype and think they are a better team than they are.It's not a conscious decision you make as a player, sitting at home watching video clips of yourself then walking out on the pitch thinking you are going to be brilliant. However, when you have been part of a good team for a long time, you can fall into a trap where you end up just thinking you need to turn up to win.It's why all the best teams down the years have needed reinvention. Sir Alex Ferguson did it time and time again at Manchester United. Pep Guardiola is the same at City now - he knows you have to keep changing things to continue being successful.Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsGet Liverpool news notificationsListen to the latest The Red Kop podcastLiverpool are still capable of magic momentsLiverpool's last league game saw them follow up their 7-0 win over Manchester United with a 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth, who were then bottom of the table. "That summed up their season so far," says MurphyIn years gone by under Klopp, the Reds would run straight through lesser opposition, and win game after game. Not this season, though. Liverpool have not been near those levels most of the time and everyone has been trying to explain why they have under-performed and looked so vulnerable defensively.There is more to it than just complacency - injures have not helped and, as the season has gone on, I've also seen a lack of confidence from them in certain games which comes from not getting the expected results earlier on.But the fact they have still done so well against the better teams confirms to me it has been more of a mind-set issue than a physical problem or a lack of quality.Chelsea are ranked 10/15 from games against the top five this season, with no wins and just two draws (and three goals) from six games. Fulham are bottom, with eight defeats out of eightWhenever you play the big teams, you are always very aware you have to be bang at it, physically and mentally, otherwise you are not going to be successful. When Liverpool have had that focus, they've got results. They have not just got the best record from those games between the top six, they've also picked up more points from the top five than anyone below them too.That's because if they play well they are more capable of hurting the top sides than anyone else, and they have proved that time and time again.Their second-half capitulation against Real Madrid at Anfield was worrying but they had started so well against the champions of Europe - and they are also one of the few teams to have beaten Napoli this season.In the Premier League, they have beaten City, they have smashed United and they have beaten Newcastle home and away - no-one else has managed that. They've definitely not become a bad team overnight.Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates after scoring the winner in the league game against Manchester City in October. He also scored when the Reds beat City 3-1 at Wembley in the Community Shield in August and was on target again when City won 3-2 at Etihad Stadium in the Carabao Cup in DecemberLiverpool's Premier League results against the top five in 2022-23HomeTeamAway9 AprilArsenalLost 3-2Won 1-0Man City1 AprilWon 7-0Man UtdLost 2-130 AprilTottenhamWon 2-1Won 2-1NewcastleWon 2-0Will City and Arsenal fear the Reds?Liverpool won't really care who wins the title now because they are thinking about themselves and making the top four, but they have a big say in who becomes champions.Apart from when City and Arsenal play each other, Liverpool are the most dangerous opponents they have left. They could even take points off both of them.Arsenal's remaining Premier League fixturesHomeAwayLeeds (1 April)Liverpool (9 April)Southampton (21 April)West Ham (16 April)Chelsea (29 April)Man City (26 April)Brighton (13 May)Newcastle (6 May)Wolves (28 May)Nottingham Forest (20 May)There are times when City are just breathtaking, but equally there have been certain games quite recently where they have not been as smooth or easy on the eye as in previous seasons.I still think going to Etihad Stadium and winning is a big ask - Liverpool have not done that in the league since Pep Guardiola arrived at City in 2016 - but if Mohamed Salah plays as well as he did in the 7-0 win against United, it won't be easy for Nathan Ake to stop him.Erling Haaland can win games for City on his own but it would give a very different perspective to that fixture if he does not recover from his groin injury in time.Man City's remaining Premier League fixturesHomeAwayLiverpool (1 April)Southampton (8 April)Leicester (15 April)Fulham (30 April)Arsenal (26 April)Everton (13 May)West Ham (3 May)Brentford (28 May)Leeds (7 May)Brighton (TBC)Chelsea (20 May)Even if Haaland does play, this Liverpool team has competed directly with City for several years now and there have been so many close games between them in that time that I don't think there will be much in it, regardless.The Arsenal players do not really have the same historic personal rivalry with Liverpool as City do but, while I don't think the Gunners will fear their trip to Anfield, they don't know what it is like to go there and win. Mikel Arteta was playing for Arsenal the last time that happened, in September 2012.Top four or not, Liverpool need a refreshChampions League is 'the' competition, we want to be part of it - KloppThis could be an amazing week for Liverpool but, whatever happens, it will be pivotal - not just to make or break their season but to decide what they do in the summer too.Lose all three games and their top-four hopes are over, which would quickly confirm to the owners they have a lot of work to do.But if they can stay in the race for the Champions League places and sneak in at the last minute, like they did in 2021, there's a chance Klopp may not get the same backing in the transfer market as he would if they don't get in.I don't know that, but it does seem logical in some respects and I've seen it happen at my old clubs before - it's one of the reasons Mark Hughes left Fulham in 2011, because he was promised money for players after a poor first half to the season but that was then reduced after we finished the season strongly.I am sure Liverpool's owners aren't naive enough to think they can get away with not investing in the squad in the summer, even if they do make the top four, but if that happens there could be a train of thought that the run-in proved the squad is actually pretty good and the team is back on track.So, this is something of a bitter-sweet situation for Liverpool fans. They will want to win all their games, because they want Champions League football and everything that it brings, but they want a refresh too - and I think they need one.I know a lot of supporters are confident that, with some investment, Klopp can get this team back to the top and fighting for the title again. I feel the same way - we've already seen them bounce back once, after their poor title defence in 2021. This is hopefully just another bump in the road but, looking at the money their rivals are spending, Klopp will definitely need some reinforcements if he is going to push this team on again.Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.Our coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content

This is less than half the scoring rate of the best teams, Brentford and Manchester City, who have both scored from 15% of their attempts.  Leeds United (14th, 26pts)Leeds United only stayed up on the final day of last season and are in another relegation battle in 2022-23. With matches still to come against Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham, it could go down to the wire again.Jesse Marsch was sacked as manager in February with the club on a seven-game winless run but Javi Gracia has made an encouraging start with wins over Southampton and Wolves as well as a draw with Brighton in three of his first four league games in charge.Still to play: 1 Apr Arsenal (a), 4 Apr Nottingham Forest (h), 9 Apr Crystal Palace (h), 17 Apr Liverpool (h), 22 Apr Fulham (a), 25 Apr Leicester (h), 30 Apr Bournemouth (a), 7 May Manchester City (a), 13 May Newcastle (h), 20 May West Ham (a), 28 May Tottenham (h)Gracenote fact: Leeds United are the only one of the relegation candidates to have won two of their past four matches.

Five of West Ham's remaining matches are against teams in the top six, but they also still have to play the bottom two - Southampton and Bournemouth - as well as relegation-threatened Crystal Palace, Leeds and Leicester.Still to play: 2 Apr Southampton (h), 5 Apr Newcastle (h), 8 Apr Fulham (a), 16 Apr Arsenal (h), 23 Apr Bournemouth (a), 26 Apr Liverpool (h), 29 Apr Crystal Palace (a), 3 May Manchester City (a), 7 May Manchester United (h), 13 May Brentford (a), 20 May Leeds (h), 28 May Leicester (a)Gracenote fact: Only the Premier League's top seven teams have had more goal attempts this season than West Ham's 342. Only five of the top seven plus Chelsea have conceded fewer goal attempts this season than West Ham's 309.Bournemouth (19th, 24pts)Bournemouth were the first top-flight team to sack their manager this season with Scott Parker, who got them promotion last season, dismissed after criticising the club's summer recruitment following a Premier League record-equalling 9-0 loss at Liverpool in August.Gary O'Neil has been their manager since, firstly on an interim basis before getting the job permanently in November. The Cherries did not win any of their first seven league matches following the World Cup but victories over Wolves and a 1-0 success over Liverpool have given them hope.Six of Bournemouth's remaining matches are against other teams in this relegation fight but four of those games are away.Still to play: 1 Apr Fulham (h), 4 Apr Brighton (h), 8 Apr Leicester (a), 15 Apr Tottenham (a), 23 Apr West Ham (h), 27 Apr Southampton (a), 30 Apr Leeds (h), 6 May Chelsea (h), 13 May Crystal Palace (a), 20 May Manchester United (h), 28 May Everton (a)Gracenote fact: Bournemouth have conceded 15 goals from corners in this season's Premier League, nearly twice as many as the next worst team at defending corners, Chelsea (eight). On average, Bournemouth concede a goal from every 13 corners they face.Southampton (20th, 23pts)Southampton are another side on their third manager of the season after they sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl in November. He was replaced by Nathan Jones, but he only lasted eight Premier League matches and picked up one win before he was also dismissed.Ruben Selles, assistant manager under Hasenhuttl, was next in line and started with a 1-0 victory at Chelsea. A win against Leicester and draws with Manchester United and Tottenham have given Saints fans some hope.However, half of Southampton's remaining 10 matches are against the top seven teams, ending the season with a home game against Liverpool.Still to play: 2 Apr West Ham (a), 8 Apr Manchester City (h), 15 Apr Crystal Palace (h), 21 Apr Arsenal (a), 27 Apr Bournemouth (h), 30 Apr Newcastle (a), 8 May Nottingham Forest (a), 13 May Fulham (h), 20 May Brighton (a), 28 May Liverpool (h).Gracenote fact: Southampton have kept fewer clean sheets this season than any other team in the Premier League.

Premier League domestic flights: BBC Sport research shows 81 flights from 100 gamesBy David LockwoodEditorial Sustainability Lead, BBC SportLast updated on 23 March 202323 March 2023.From the section Premier Leaguecomments1981The 100 fixtures studied included 82 Premier League games, 13 FA Cup fixtures with the Premier League team playing away from home, and five EFL Cup matches. BBC Sport analysed data from Flightradar24, cross-referencing from the UK Sports Aviation twitter account.BBC Sport research has found evidence of 81 individual short-haul domestic flights made by Premier League teams to and from 100 matches during a two-month sample period this year.Whether it's Trent Alexander-Arnold on a flight back from Newcastle to Liverpool, Chelsea's Ben Chilwell flying from London to Leicester or Nottingham Forest players on their way from East Midlands Airport to Blackpool, occasional social media posts have so far been the only insight to inform the debate around Premier League clubs flying small distances to matches instead of travelling by road or rail.Now, a study of 100 games played in the UK involving Premier League teams between 19 January and 19 March 2023 has given the first insight into the volume of the controversial journeys, some as short as 27 minutes. And for the first time the study also shows details of 'positioning' flights - where near-empty planes are flown to convenient airports, sometimes across the UK, in order to then transport players and staff to fixtures.The Sports Desk podcast: Should Premier League clubs stop flying to domestic games?The study suggests: 81 individual domestic flights by Premier League clubs (including return journeys)Of those 81 flights, the breakdown was 59 flights for Premier League fixtures; 16 for FA Cup games and six for EFL Cup matchesThe shortest flight was just 27 minutes; the longest 77 minutesThe average duration of these 81 flights was 42 minutes.Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.BBC Sport contacted all Premier League clubs with the flight information.In addition to these 'player movement' flights, the research also suggested a significant number of connected 'positioning' flights. The study found: 37 of the 81 player flights had a flight marked as 'positioning' beforehandThe longest 'positioning' flight was 84 minutes; the shortest just 17 minutesThe average duration of the 37 'positioning' flights in the study was 42 minutesFlights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport, with short-haul flights the worst emitters, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Should clubs stop flying to domestic matches for environmental reasons?Find out more about sport and climate changeWhat about these 'positioning' flights?'Positioning' flights are where the plane is getting into position to pick up its private charter passengers. They are normally what the aviation industry calls "empty leg" flights - so without passengers and therefore qualify as 'ghost' flights, a term increasingly being used to describe any flight with fewer than 10% passengers. BBC Sport contacted the airlines involved but received no confirmation as to the number of passengers on these flights.As the Premier League's most southerly team, Bournemouth perhaps have more justification than others to fly to some games. They flew to Birmingham airport and back on the weekend of 17-18 March for their fixture with Aston Villa - a return journey totalling 73 minutes.But the data pointed towards a further four 'positioning flights' connected to this trip - three of which were to or from Scotland - totalling an additional 201 minutes.In addition to the 37 marked positioning flights, the BBC Sport research also observed instances of planes flying from one London airport to another in advance of a player flight - although not marked as 'positioning' flights. It is therefore possible the actual number could be higher.

The need to fly often depends on kick-off time, the time in between our matches and the reliability of alternative transport methods."The biggest emissions are generated from stadiums on matchdays and fan travel - which is the sport's biggest climate footprint. The Premier League statement said its work will also include "encouraging fans" to "consider how" they can reduce their own carbon footprint.However, Dale Vince, chairman of League One side Forest Green, regarded as the world's most sustainable football team, called it "shocking data in just two months", adding: "It's an illusion to think there is a gain for a flight of that duration, modern coaches are very comfortable and aren't going to impair the performance of the players over that short distance"Vince believes the Premier League and its clubs should lead the way.Vince said: "The carbon impact is one thing… I think the bigger impact is the emotional one, the intellectual one, you've got Premier League teams setting a very bad example for the rest of the country... when we are desperately in need of getting to net zero. "This comes just days after the latest UN report that says we absolutely have just a few years left to act to avoid the worst of the climate crisis."The Premier League has signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework and as a result is tasked with reaching net zero by 2040. That was in November 2021 but it is yet to confirm its plans.The statement added: "The Premier League is in the process of developing an environmental sustainability strategy, which will set out plans to deliver climate action. As part of this strategy, the league will continue to engage with and work alongside clubs and partners, to find practical ways of reducing football's environmental impact."View more on twitterWhat are the factors?Premier League clubs have been travelling this way for years - generally the quickest and most convenient option which clubs argue gives players and staff maximum time to prepare and recover between games, when the global fixture schedule is increasingly packed - something the clubs have no control over.It is only recently, as players started to frequently post images on social media of these short domestic flights, that it attracted increased scrutiny in an era of climate impact awareness.As this season shows, competition in the Premier League is as fierce as ever - just four points separates the bottom nine teams as they scramble to stay in the division and reap the multi-million pound rewards.With such fine margins and enormous financial consequences, will clubs really risk a potential disadvantage by opting for slower but more environmentally friendly travel to high-stakes fixtures? Matt Konipinski is director of physio and performance at Rehab 4 Performance and has worked with Liverpool, Rangers and Barnsley football clubs. He disputes the performance argument, but does acknowledge that in a busy schedule time might be the overriding concern. He said: "I think physical condition is a consideration but I think the mode of travel doesn't necessarily have a huge amount of scientific support to justify one versus the other."We're talking about the options around whether a team might fly, whether a team may take the coach, whether a team may take the train and really the main emphasis around flying is speed and the top teams will prioritise speed over everything else."View more on instagramThere is no previous flight information to compare season with season. However, clubs have told BBC Sport that this season the cost of chartering planes has almost doubled as a result of both the rise in the price of fuel and decreased availability of planes after the pandemic and Brexit. With pressure to spend money to attract better players, plus the increased focus on sustainability in the game, many clubs said the plane is the last resort - and that this 2022-23 season might actually see a reduction in flights from previous years. And that is despite running issues with England's rail network.external-linkChelsea manager Graham Potter gave an honest appraisal of the challenges facing football, saying: "I think it's something we increasingly have to look at, because I think it's something we have to do better with. It's my personal opinion. That's not to say its straightforward because there are factors, but I think it's an area we can improve."Nottingham Forest were one of the few clubs who shared their full flight data with BBC Sport and a spokesperson said they anticipated using flights in four of their 23 away fixtures this season and added: "The club will always use rail or road travel unless there are overwhelming logistical and sporting reasons not to do so."Many clubs reference fixture scheduling across multiple domestic and European competitions and then changes made by broadcasters with expensive TV rights - factors outside their control.An English Football Association statement added: "Establishing a more environmentally sustainable approach across English football is very important, and we encourage everyone in the game to help play their part. It is the responsibility of each club to make their own operational travel choices across all competitions, including for Premier League, EFL and FA Cup matches."Former QPR player Michael Doughty - now chief of sustainability at Swindon Town - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I think there needs to be some legislation or some feedback from the Premier League around what is a distance of travel viable for flying, and also some feedback from the clubs around performance. "We're assuming plane travel is optimising for performance, but I haven't seen any clear studies that have shown that."Ben Chilwell, left, posting on Instagram on a flight with his Chelsea team-matesAnalysis: Why has BBC Sport done this research?What football does in this area matters because it is the world's most popular sport and has the potential to influence so many millions of people all over the world. The Premier League is not only the most popular domestic league in the world, it is also one of Britain's biggest exports.There is no doubt that the more football there is, the less chance it can be truly sustainable, until something significant changes. While it is obvious the football authorities clearly don't control the clubs' travel plans, it is equally obvious to state that the clubs do not control the schedules, so when does the circular argument break?To that end this research is intended to better inform a debate that, up until now, has too often focused on one team at a time and been anecdotal, a cycle from which many think it is impossible to see progress. That includes acknowledging the relatively small emissions we are talking about but at the same time giving credence to what Vince called an "example" and others call an "opportunity" for the power and influence of football to be put to immense positive effect.Sport has a long track record of bringing wider societal issues to the fore, and football has a more powerful role in that than any sport. A conversation about this domestic flight issue in the world of sport brings in discussion about the state of public transport in the UK, and the present and future of air travel.Why do we not hear the biggest names in football speaking up on environmental issues to big audiences like they do on other issues? Is it because we haven't been able to progress the conversation in football? Is it because the emissions are not as apparent as other sports?It might make sense for Formula 1 drivers to be quiet on environmental issues and yet we have Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg all speaking up. Where is football's 'world champion'?*BBC Sport has had a Sustainability Strategy in place since 2021 which includes a no domestic flight policy.
