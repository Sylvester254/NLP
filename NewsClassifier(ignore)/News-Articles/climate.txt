Climate change: England not ready for impactPublished2 days agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsUK heatwavesImage source, PA MediaBy Esme StallardClimate and Science Reporter, BBC NewsEngland is not ready for the unavoidable impacts of global warming, the government's advisers on climate change say in a new report.The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said the government hasn't achieved any of its targets and needed a policy "step change" to avoid loss of life.The CCC reviews the government's adaptation plans - preparations to cope with the effects of global warming.The government said it would take the recommendations into account.Four ways climate change is affecting weatherIs the UK getting hotter?What will climate change look like near me?A really simple guide to climate change  The committee, also known as the CCC, is an independent group of experts set up to provide the government with advice on the climate crisis.Baroness Brown, chairwoman of the CCC's sub-committee on adaptation, said that the government wasn't taking the issue seriously enough. "The government's lack of urgency on climate resilience is in sharp contrast to the recent experience of this country," she said.Over the last couple of years, England has faced a series of extreme weather events, likely made worse by climate change.Last year was the warmest on record for the UK - temperatures broke 40C for the first time and more than 25,000 wildfires broke out.Image source, Christopher FurlongImage caption, Sheffield was hit by wildfires last year as summer temperatures breached 40C in parts of EnglandAs well as extreme heat, rainfall has been consistently low for parts of south and southeast England, affecting crop yields.Andrew Blenkiron's 6,000-acre (24 sq km) farm in Thetford, Norfolk saw just 2.4mm of rain in February compared to the local average for that month of 43mm. He has now been forced to cut back on plans to plant potatoes, onions, parsnips and carrots by around a fifth.He said: "Farmers are at the very forefront of climate change on a day-to-day basis... we are used to working with these issues, but we are concerned with the extremes we are now facing."To cope with the impacts of extreme heat Mr Blenkiron has enlarged reservoirs on his farm and shifted harvesting patterns to prevent wildfires. But he said that farmers needed more money from government to implement their climate plans, especially if they involved new infrastructure projects like reservoirs.Image source, John Cottle / NFUImage caption, Andrew Blenkiron has adapted his farm to reduce emissions and lower the impact of climate changeA UK government spokesperson told the BBC: "We have taken decisive action to improve the UK's climate change resilience - including investing a record Â£5.2bn into flood defences."The spokesperson said the government would factor in the committee's recommendations to the new National Adaptation Plan, which is expected to be published this summer. The committee said the government needed to consider the resilience of farming systems in other countries. Nearly half of all the food the UK consumes is imported. The CCC said this makes all of the UK's food supply vulnerable to global weather patterns.Already this year supermarkets have placed limits on fruit and vegetable sales after bad weather in North Africa affected supply. The committee has recommended the government require all large food sector companies by law to assess the climate risks to their supply chains.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Climate change could lead to more empty supermarket shelvesThe committee reviewed the government's plans across 12 other areas - from buildings to transport to nature. They found that just five out of the 45 policy areas had fully credible climate change plans and none were making progress to improve climate resilience.The committee commended the government for updating building regulations last year for new domestic properties - requiring developers to take account of overheating. But they said this needed to be extended to cover all existing homes - as 80% of all homes that will be around in 2050 have already been built. As many as 4.6 million homes overheat, according to a recent survey, putting those with existing health conditions like asthma at risk. Internet at riskThe report singled out England's internet networks as being woefully unprepared for climate change despite their crucial importance.England's internet networks - made up of hundreds of data centres, and extensive networks of cables and masts - underpin the UK's service-based economy.This infrastructure is already at risk from extreme weather, including heat and strong winds during storms. In November 2021, Storm Arwen left one million British properties without power and internet supply. The committee found "there was no visible plan by the industry or government, to manage long-term risk".Image source, Ian ForsythImage caption, The UK's internet supply is at risk from extreme weather as shown during Storm ArwenMatt Evans, director of Markets at techUK, the UK's tech trade association, told the BBC the report showed there needed to be better collaboration across industry and government. But he said it "doesn't fully capture the resiliency strategies employed by high-tech industries".  The committee did praise local governments for innovative climate change preparation, including the work of Kent County Council to help farmers switch their crops to those that will fare better in warmer weather.But Baroness Brown said that central government needed to better support local adaptation plans by providing more funding and more region-specific information on future threats.Related TopicsDroughtUK heatwavesClimate changeMore on this storyFour ways climate change is affecting weather20 MarchUK costs from flood damage could rise by 20%7 MarchUK heatwave broke dozens of records, new data shows14 October 2022View comments

Swiss court case ties human rights to climate changePublished2 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsClimate changeImage source, ReutersImage caption, Glaciers in the Alps are at particular risk of rising temperatures due to climate changeBy Imogen Foulkes & Adam DurbinBBC NewsMore than 2,000 women are taking the Swiss government to court claiming its policy on climate change is violating their right to life and health. The case is the first time the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) will hear a case on the impact of climate change on human rights.It follows six years of unsuccessful battles through the Swiss courts. Temperatures in Switzerland are rising faster than the global average and there are ever more frequent heatwaves. The Swiss women - who call themselves the Club of Climate Seniors and have an average age of 73 - say climate change is putting their human rights, their health and even their lives at risk. Their evidence to the court includes their medical records. They want the ECHR to order Switzerland to work harder at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the campaigners, Elisabeth Stern, told the BBC: "Due to climate change, we have more heatwaves and older women suffer more. They die more often during these heatwaves than they otherwise would. "Some people say, why are you complaining, you're going to die anyway. But we don't want to die just because our Swiss government has not been successful in coming up with a decent climate policy." The European Climate and Health Observatory says that projected increases in average temperature are likely to have "serious impacts on public health" across Europe, particularly among elderly people.In the last 20 years, heat-related mortality in people older than 65 in Europe has increased by more than 30%, it says. The Swiss government does not deny that climate change can affect health - but says it cannot be tied specifically to older women's health. If the women are successful, the case could set a precedent for every one of the European court's 46 member states.World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100.According to the UN climate body, the IPCC, if global temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C, Europe will be vulnerable to flooding caused by extreme rainfall.Extreme temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires - as seen in Europe last summer. France and Germany recorded about seven times more land burnt between January and the middle of July 2022, compared with the average.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, World's largest ice rink closed due to lack of iceRelated TopicsHuman rightsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeEuropean Court of Human RightsClimate changeSwitzerlandMore on this storyUN releases 'survival guide' to avert climate disaster20 MarchA really simple guide to climate change17 MarchSnow shortage threatens Alps with wet winter season3 January

UN climate report: Scientists release 'survival guide' to avert climate disasterPublished20 MarchShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCOP28Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met in Switzerland where glaciers are meltingBy Matt McGrath and Georgina Rannardin Interlaken and CardiffUN chief Antonio Guterres says a major new report on climate change is a "survival guide for humanity".Clean energy and technology can be exploited to avoid the growing climate disaster, the report says.But at a meeting in Switzerland to agree their findings, climate scientists warned a key global temperature goal will likely be missed.Their report lays out how rapid cuts to fossil fuels can avert the worst effects of climate change. Five things we've learned from new UN climate reportIn response to the findings, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres says that all countries should bring forward their net zero plans by a decade. These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere."There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all," the report states.Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must "work towards far more ambitious climate commitments" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November."The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster," a spokesperson said. Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: "While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action." A really simple guide to climate changeFour ways climate change is affecting weatherUS government approves Alaska Willow oil projectDrought risk to England regions after dry FebruaryThe report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. "Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario," the report states."If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying," Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News."And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying."The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. What you can do to reduce carbon emissionsThe state of the climate in 2023What is carbon capture - and how can it fight climate change?And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. "There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget," Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.Image source, IPCCImage caption, World-leading scientists wrote the UN report which must also be agreed on by governments"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target."The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a "temporary overshoot". The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.Some observers have their doubts. "We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction," said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. "Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect," he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.Related TopicsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeCOP28COP26Climate change

What is climate change? A really simple guidePublished17 MarchShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsOur Planet NowImage source, Getty ImagesWorld temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, rising sea levels and mass extinction of species. The world faces a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.What is climate change?Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. However, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by then. A 2021 report by the independent Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.If nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels, and the irreversible loss of plant and animal species. What are the impacts of climate change?Extreme weather events are already more intense across the globe, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. East Africa just saw its fifth season of failed rains, which the UN's World Food Programme says has put up to 22 million people at risk of severe hunger.Extreme temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires - as seen in Europe last summer. France and Germany recorded about seven times more land burnt between January and the middle of July 2022, compared with the average.Hotter temperatures also mean that previously frozen ground will melt in places like Siberia, releasing greenhouse gases trapped for centuries into the atmosphere, further worsening climate change.In other regions, extreme rainfall caused historic flooding last year - as seen in China, Pakistan and Nigeria.People living in developing countries are expected to suffer the most as they have fewer resources to adapt to climate change. But there is frustration from these nations as they have produced the least greenhouse gas emissions.The planet's oceans and its habitats are also under threat. Research published in April 2022, funded by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, suggests that between 10% and 15% of marine species are already at risk of extinction.In a warmer world, land animals will also find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken.

Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.

What was agreed at COP27?Five key climate takeaways from COP27Climate costs deal struck but no fossil fuel progressMany countries have pledged to get to "net zero" by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that this is still achievable, but requires governments, businesses and individuals to make substantial changes now.What can individuals do?Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:take fewer flightslive car-free or use an electric carreduce consumption of meat and dairy productsreduce your energy usebuy energy efficient products, such as washing machines, when they need replacingimprove your home insulationswitch from a gas heating system to an electric heat pumpTop image from Getty Images.

Climate change: Four things you can do about your carbon footprintPublished4 November 2022Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCOP26Image source, Getty ImagesBy Daniel Kraemer & Joe WhitwellBBC NewsTackling climate change will require world leaders to take action on a global level.But as individuals we also contribute to warming emissions. Here are some things you can do to reduce your personal impact.1. Insulate your homeFrom installing a heat pump to turning down the heating, there is a raft of changes around the home that can help the planet. "Switching from a gas or oil-powered heating system to an electric heat pump makes a considerable difference," according to Dr Neil Jennings, an academic from Imperial College London. "On a day-to-day basis, switching off lights and appliances when not in use can help us to save money while reducing our impact on climate change."The UK government currently offers grants of Â£5,000 for the installation of heat pumps in England and Wales. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme runs until 2025.How do heat pumps work and how do I get one?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprintImproving insulation in our walls, ceilings and windows can reduce the loss of heat from our homes and the amount of energy needed to heat them.Draught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective forms of insulation, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST). This involves blocking up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out, such as around windows, doors or skirting boards. The EST estimates that draught-proofing could save Â£125 a year on average household bills.How can better insulation cut energy bills?Switching to a green energy provider or a green tariff can significantly reduce your household's carbon footprint. But a recent increase in wholesale energy prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means many providers have withdrawn their offers.How to save energy at home and help the planet2. Cut out food waste and cut down on red meatLivestock creates 14% of all greenhouse gases globally, with cattle being by far the largest contributor. The simplest and most effective way to limit your impact is to reduce meat and dairy in your diet, particularly red meat such as lamb and beef.Good news for vegans, obviously - but there are other considerations to take into account.It's not just a question of "tagging individual products as good or bad", says biologist Prof Margaret Gill of the University of Aberdeen. She says the carbon footprint of any given food also depends on how it is produced, where it comes from and whether it's in season.Dr Jonathan Foley, who investigates climate change solutions, says you can save money and reduce waste by making smaller portions and saving leftovers for later at home.The world wastes between 25% and 30% of its food, according to the Waste & Resources Action Programme. Between 8-10% of global carbon emissions are linked to unconsumed produce, according to a UN report.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Climate Basics: CO2 explained3. Drive less, fly lessTransport is responsible for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions.Living car-free might be "the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our transport emissions," according to Dr Jennings. However, ditching the car is not possible for everyone, particularly if you live in an area without good public transport or are disabled.Small steps still have an impact, like walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours. Electric cars are becoming more widespread, but they are still prohibitively expensive for some people and charging infrastructure is limited in places. Unfortunately for keen travellers, flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things we can do as individuals.Domestic flights have the largest emissions per person per kilometre. Train journeys can have less than a fifth of the impact of a domestic flight, although they might be more expensive. Booking in advance can help reduce the cost."For those who fly a lot, reducing the number of flights you take will make a considerable difference to your personal footprint," says Dr Jennings.Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype?4.

You could also try buying second-hand.Choosing the right household appliances can also have a positive effect on your carbon footprint. Dr Jennings suggests making sure you are buying the most energy-efficient products, such as washing machines, when they need replacing.How can you reduce your fashion footprint?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Deforestation: Whatâs wrong with planting new forests?Related TopicsTransportCOP26Climate changeCarbon footprint

Carbon capture: What is it and how does it fight climate change?Published19 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsClimate changeImage source, InphoBy Jonah FisherBBC Environment CorrespondentThe UK government has announced that the first sites in the UK to capture greenhouse gases will be in Teesside. The carbon capture plants are designed to prevent carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial processes and power stations being released into the atmosphere.The announcement was part of the government's new Net Zero Strategy and aims to move the UK closer to meeting its legally-binding carbon commitments.  New UK plan to reach net zero goal faces criticismIs the UK on track to meet its climate targets?How does carbon capture work?Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits CO2, which is the main driver of climate change. The carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground.The UK government wants a new power station where carbon dioxide is captured and stored under the North Sea - either in old oil and gas reservoirs, or permeable rocks known as saline aquifers.Why is carbon capture needed?Carbon capture power plants are part of the government's commitment to remove carbon from UK electricity production by 2035. It hopes to build at least one by the mid 2020s, although that deadline now looks improbable. There has been a big expansion in renewable energy in the last decade - in particular the use of offshore wind - but the unresolved question is how to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing. Carbon capture power stations are seen as part of the solution, along with the increased use of nuclear energy, and other rapidly-evolving technologies such as hydrogen. A really simple guide to climate change  Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets?Where will the new power station be built?The government has now agreed to go ahead with funding three carbon capture plants near Redcar on Teesside. One will capture carbon from a gas-fired power station and the two others from hydrogen production. All would require the construction of a pipeline to transport the captured CO2 under the North Sea for storage. How much CO2 will these plants remove?In 2021, the UK emitted 425 million tonnes of CO2. That's fallen by almost 50% since 1990. The amount being captured at these proposed power stations is very small by comparison. None of the proposed carbon capture plants claims to capture more than two million tonnes a year. The government has set a target to capture between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030. That could involve other industrial processes as well as power generation. How much will carbon capture cost?The technology has been around for decades. It's mainly been used in industries where captured CO2 can be reused, for example to force out oil and gas from underground reserves. There are no such plans to use the CO2 from the new proposed power stations. The cost of a new gas power station, providing electricity for nearly a million homes, is around Â£350m.Catherine Raw of energy company SSE told the BBC that building a similar sized gas power station with carbon capture would roughly double the cost.The hope is that the price might fall over time. The cost of renewable energy for example has plummeted in the last decade.There are those who see carbon capture as too expensive and believe the money would be better spent on renewables and power storage (like batteries). "These power stations look like another excuse for the government to show preference to their friends in the oil and gas industry, making energy more expensive to everyone else's disadvantage," says Dr Doug Parr of campaign group Greenpeace UK.  Do other countries have carbon capture?In September 2022 there were just 30 carbon capture facilities in the world, according to a report from the Global CCS Institute.Almost all of these are attached to industrial plants carrying out activities such as natural gas processing or fertiliser production.Once built, it is hoped other industries would use the UK power station's pipeline to store CO2 under the North Sea.  Image source, AlamyImage caption, Built in 2014, the Boundary Dam power station removes up to 90% of the CO2 it generatesThe only carbon capture power station currently operating is a coal-fired plant at Boundary Dam in western Canada. However, several carbon capture gas power stations similar to those proposed in the UK are in development, mostly in the US.Related TopicsCarbon capture and storageGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergy industryClimate changeRenewable energyCarbon neutrality

Guernsey's emissions lower than pre-pandemic - StatesPublished6 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, Transport is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases in Guernsey is transportBy John FernandezBBC Guernsey political reporterGuernsey's greenhouse gas emissions remain "significantly lower" than pre-pandemic levels, the States says.In the latest report on the island's total emissions, the States said 293.2 kilotons were emitted in 2021 - about 4.6 tonnes per person.The figure is slightly higher than the 292.5 kilotons emitted in 2020. Both years were affected by coronavirus.The biggest contributor to emissions in 2021 was transport, which made up about a third of the total, the data said.The report predicted emissions to rise to 336.1 kilotons in 2022.However, the States said the estimate was still significantly lower than the 447 kilotons emitted in 2019.'Right direction'Deputy Lindsay de Sausmarez, President of the Committee for the Environment and Infrastructure, said year-on-year reductions in emissions were being made. "Our emissions from 2020 and 2021 were always going to be something of an anomaly with unprecedented reductions in transport and commercial energy use due to lockdowns," she said."However, with the provisional estimate for 2022 below pre-Covid levels, the data suggest we are heading in the right direction."She said efforts were under way to reduce emissions from transport by making the overall network more efficient."It's so interlinked with housing so we do have a big focus on transport because we can't deliver the housing we need unless we also make our transport system more efficient," she said.Deputy de Sausmarez also credited a waste reduction strategy - which sees non-recyclable waste exported via the UK to Sweden to be incinerated and turned into energy - for emissions reductions.Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.
