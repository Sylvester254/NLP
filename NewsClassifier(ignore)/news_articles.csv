sports,"Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresBy Simon StoneBBC SportLast updated on 30 March 202330 March 2023.From the section Man UtdManchester United fans have protested against the club's owners, the Glazer Family, who are considering selling up and have invited bidsManchester United owe £969.6m through a combination of gross debt, bank borrowings and outstanding transfer fees with associated payments, according to new figures.The club released their second quarter results to 31 December on Thursday.Unlike previous years, there was no investors' call afterwards as a result of the ongoing ""strategic review"".This could lead to the sale of the Premier League club.The review itself is centred on how to meet the club's long-term capital investment needs, specifically for improvements to Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training ground, and - it is being stressed - is not due to any issues with short-term liquidity.Nevertheless, the amount owed the club has grown.While the principal debt remains at $650m, a change in the exchange rate meant the club owed £535.7m compared to £477.1m at the same point in the previous year.In addition, £206.2m has been taken from a rolling credit facility, with another £227.7m owed in outstanding transfer fees. The club did have £31m in cash or equivalent, but the overall sum remains just short of £1bn.BBC Sport has been told the figures are evidence of a ""stretched"" financial situation, although it is being stressed that this has already changed for the better, due to bumper matchday revenues and impressive season ticket sales - and they expect that to continue.Indeed, in posting profits of £6.3m for the quarter, United have also revealed sponsorship revenue has increased 43.2% to £50.4m over the prior quarter. The club said this was due to the impact of their training kit agreement with Tezos, plus a 'one-off sponsorship credit', which they have opted not to detail.Wages were down £20.4m to £77.3m, a decrease of 20.9% as Erik ten Hag's team are not in this season's Champions League.Will Man Utd build a new stadium?Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man Utd news notificationsListen to the latest The Devils' Advocate podcastOur coverage of Manchester United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything United - go straight to all the best content"
sports,"Felix Jones: England recruit ex-Ireland full-back as assistant coachLast updated on 30 March 202330 March 2023.From the section Rugby UnionFelix Jones joined South Africa as a defence consultant in 2019Former Ireland full-back Felix Jones will leave South Africa's coaching set-up and join England as an assistant coach after the 2023 World Cup.Jones joined the Springboks in 2019 as a defence consultant and helped the side win the 2019 World Cup in Japan.He has continued to be based in the UK, and South Africa director of rugby Rassie Erasmus understands Jones' decision to be closer to his family.""It's a big loss to lose a coach of Felix's calibre,"" said Erasmus. Central contracts a 'good idea' - BrownDupont wins third Six Nations player awardEngland say Felix, who has won 13 Ireland caps and was part of the 2015 Six Nations title-winning squad, will join head coach Steve Borthwick's team after the World Cup finishes in late October.Erasmus added: ""While we are saddened by the decision, we know how difficult it was for him to make that call and we fully understand the reasons. ""He's been an asset to the Springboks in the last few years and the way he has evolved in his role and willingly took on additional responsibilities to ensure that the team functioned as optimally as possible in his areas of expertise, has been admirable. ""We know Felix will remain fully committed to the Springboks' cause and give everything as we attempt to defend our World Cup title in France, and hopefully we can make it a special and memorable send-off for him later this year.""Jones also played for Leinster and Munster before being forced to retire at the age of 28 because of a neck injury.He then went straight into the coaching staff at Munster where he worked under Erasmus for the 2016-17 season.After helping Munster to three consecutive European Champions Cup semi-finals, he helped South Africa win the 2019 World Cup and the British and Irish Lions series two years later."
sports,"Premier League tightens ownership rules to stop human rights abusers running a clubLast updated on 30 March 202330 March 2023.From the section Premier LeagueThe Premier League's new owners' and directors' test rules were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on ThursdayThe Premier League has tightened its ownership rules to block anyone found to have committed human rights abuses from running a club.Human rights abuses, as determined by the UK's Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations, is a new ""disqualifying event"" in the English top-flight's owners' and directors' test.Individuals subject to UK government sanctions will also be banned.The changes to the test will be applied immediately.The Premier League has also amended the list of criminal offences which would result in disqualification, including those which involve violence, corruption, fraud, tax evasion and hate crimes.It also has new power to stop those wishing to become a director of a club if they are under investigation for conduct that would result in a disqualifying event if it is proven.Human rights group Amnesty International said the move was ""a step in the right direction"", but warned the Premier League still risked becoming a ""sportswashing toy"" if the rules were not properly implemented.Conservative MP Tracey Crouch, who was the UK's Sport Minister between 2017 and 2018, said the changes were ""smoke and mirrors"".English football's new regulator 'can't be a sledgehammer'Premier League 'reviewing ownership test'The Sport Desk podcast: The battle for football's futureThe new rules, which were unanimously approved at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, come into force at a time when the ownership of a number of Premier League clubs is under scrutiny.Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim is among the bidders for Manchester United and the prospect of Qatari investment in a Premier League club has raised concerns among human rights and LGBTQ+ groups.The nation's treatment of migrant workers has been criticised, while homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar. Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years and even death by stoning. However, BBC Sport understands Jassim does not believe the strengthened owners' and directors' test will have any impact on his offer to buy the 20-time English champions because he has made the bid as a private individual.Manchester United: Premier League club owe almost £1bn, reveal new figuresEarlier this month, Amnesty said the Premier League ""needs to re-examine the assurances"" it was given about potential Saudi state control of Newcastle United.Newcastle's takeover by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was approved after the Premier League received ""legally binding assurances"" the Saudi government would not have any control over the club.Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told a committee of MPs on Tuesday he could not comment on whether his organisation was investigating who has control of Newcastle and whether it was re-examining its approval of the club's Saudi takeover.Last year, Russian businessman Roman Abramovich sold Chelsea after being sanctioned by the UK for his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he denied.Introducing a more stringent owners' and directors' test will be among the powers held by English football's new independent regulator, which was confirmed by a government white paper last month.""[The] Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations are already the law of the land so this is nothing new,"" said Crouch in response to the Premier League's announcement.""Improvement always welcome but still don't go as far as white paper.""Amnesty UK's economic affairs director Peter Frankental added: ""It'll make little difference unless powerful individuals linked to serious human rights violations overseas are definitively barred from taking control of Premier League clubs and using them for state sportswashing.""Would, for instance, a future bid involving Saudi or Qatari sovereign wealth funds be blocked by this rule change? It's far from clear that they would.""Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment"
business,"What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?Published3 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Robert Cuffe & Christine JeavansBBC Data Journalism TeamHouse prices have fallen in recent months, as rising interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, and high inflation has reduced people's spending power. But mortgage interest rates may be stabilising. How might this affect house prices? What is happening to house prices around the UK?Prices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022. But they have fallen by more than 4% from that peak, according to March's figures from the Nationwide Building Society. These figures, which take seasonal peaks and troughs into account, show the largest fall in Scotland and the smallest in the West Midlands.

Those recent changes build on very different patterns of growth over the last 15 years. Northern Ireland's house prices have still not returned to the levels seen before the 2008 global financial crisis.In contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015, then saw less growth during the race-for-space period of the pandemic, which saw many people relocate to cheaper areas.

What happens when house prices fall?The biggest immediate effect is on people who want to move.Some sellers may delay putting their homes on the market. Homeowners who are considering moving may find they have less money to spend. Image source, Getty ImagesAsking prices have not fallen far enough to balance the increased cost of interest rates, so first-time buyers are unlikely to find buying a house more affordable in the short term. In the longer run, if wages increase faster than house prices recover, housing will become more affordable. Those longer term trends also depend on whether housebuilding keeps up with demand. What has happened to the government's housebuilding target? Will house prices crash?The UK's largest lender, Lloyds, is planning for a 7% fall in 2023. In March, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which advises the government on the health of the economy, predicted that house prices will drop by 10% over the next two years.That would be about half the size of the fall seen during the financial crisis of 2008 and put prices back to where they were in autumn 2021. But predictions are very uncertain.Interest rates may stabilise. The rates offered for fixed-rate mortgage deals have come down from their peak, and experts hope that the rate that sets the cost for trackers or variable rate mortgages may also be at or close to the top. How high could interest rates go? Why are prices rising so much?But interest rates are still higher than they were a year ago, and that has affected the market.A small uptick in the number of new mortgages in February did not undo the sharp falls seen at the end of 2022.  About 100,000 households come off a fixed-price mortgage each month. They will be hit by new, higher rates.Some homeowners may find their new monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell, possibly pushing prices down.

Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.




Are people struggling to pay their mortgage?The Financial Conduct Authority believes that there are more potentially ""financially stretching"" mortgages in London and the South East than in the rest of the country.Loans in the south tend to be very high compared with borrowers' incomes. This can make the loans difficult to repay when mortgage rates rise or inflation bites. This analysis is one way to look for potential areas of weakness in the market. But it doesn't guarantee that people in these areas will fall behind on their mortgage payments. Most borrowers in recent years have had their ability to pay checked against higher interest rates than the ones we're currently seeing. Lending rules were tightened after the 2008 crash to help ensure people were better prepared for a more difficult economic climate. What happens if I can't afford to pay my mortgage?Fortunately, the number of people behind on their mortgages did not rise significantly in 2022 and was still at half the 2008 level.  The number of repossessions in 2022 was also less than a tenth of what was seen in the years after the crash.  The amount people can spend of their mortgage also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures: on energy bills, wages and job security.And these factors can all change significantly. The future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole, and that picture is also uncertain. Data visualisation by Rob England and Jana Tauschinski.

Salaries are the same but expenses [are] at least double.""A steep rise in the price of essentials was already a drain for Santa, but when her landlord raised monthly rents by nearly two-thirds in June, it was a direct hit. Santa, a 32-year-old social worker and teacher, and her husband live in the tech city of Bengaluru. They both provide for their respective families, while managing their own expenses. Santa is the sole provider for five members of her family and has two jobs in order to earn extra money.Their landlord raised the rent from 7,000 rupees ($86; £70) to Rs11,500 all in one go to compensate for not having put it up during the pandemic, but Santa says this is just bad timing. Prices of perishables and food have almost doubled in the past year. The rapid rate at which prices have risen, especially for food and fuel, is eating into the households' budgets. Even though retail inflation eased to a three-month low in October, that's brought little relief. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Consumer goods sales hit a record high during Diwali, but cheaper products didn't sell as wellNow the family, whose monthly income is Rs20,000, has had to rework its expenses. This means cutting down on all frills and even some essentials. ""My parents love their tea, but for the last one year they must not have had milk tea. I buy dry groceries in limited quantities, only as much as we need, but daily expenses on fresh milk, vegetables, meat has been unmanageable.""As a social worker Santa's job requires her to travel across the city, but bus fares have risen significantly. ""A daily bus pass which used to cost Rs30 earlier, now costs nearly Rs90.""The pandemic had already drained resources for Santa's family leaving them with limited disposable income. ""I have no savings left. I have even pawned my gold jewellery last year when my father was hospitalised.""Covid, followed by the Russia-Ukraine war and the supply chain disruptions made everything expensive. Burdened by this dual blow there has been a perceptible change in consumption patterns in India - particularly among middle and lower income families. The dichotomy in India's economic recovery is apparent. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Internet sales were strong during the festival season in September and OctoberA look at the buoyant stock markets and big companies' strong quarterly profit statements shows the shiny growth story. But a closer look reveals a widening economic disparity. Most consumer goods companies have seen a drop in sales of entry-level or value products - from footwear to mobile phones to biscuits. Expensive brands, however, performed better than the mass market products. Even during the festival season in September and October, when consumer goods sales were at a record high, it was the essentials and high-end products that did the best. Sales of entry-level products across all categories saw a near 10% decline compared with last year. E-commerce in India saw a strong festive season in September and October with sales of nearly Rs755bn, according to a report by market intelligence firm RedSeer. But the finer print shows the average spend per customer has stayed subdued.After two years of Covid lockdowns and quieter festivities, Indians geared up to celebrate the festival of lights in full fervour. Streets were lit up and people decorated their houses with electric lights and earthen lamps. But it seems the celebrations in many households differed from previous years.Consumers did indulge despite the rapid rise in prices, but not everyone joined in - and those who did were choosy.The impact was more pronounced in rural and semi-urban India, home to more than half of the country's huge middle class.Image source, SarikaImage caption, Sarika's food bill has almost doubled in the past yearSarika, a 47-year-old housewife, is one of them. She chose to recycle old dresses for the big annual festival of Diwali in October. While it is a tradition to buy new clothes for the festival, Sarika says the family has been making cuts in almost everything - from clothes to sweets and even basic foodstuffs.Her monthly food bill has almost doubled in the past year. ""From edible oils, to wheat, to cereals, vegetables - all have become costlier by 30-50%. Family expenses have almost doubled in last one year, we cannot afford to buy new clothes for everyone."" What's not rising is Sarika's family income. Her husband's watch shop is seeing fewer customers as they hold on to their old watches for longer or shift to online sales. The family farm suffered crop losses due to unseasonal rainfall: ""I had to prioritise daily needs and paying school and college fees my three children over other necessities,"" she says.Sarika says the excitement surrounding the festival was already low as her son didn't travel from Pune, 150km (93 miles) from Mumbai, for Diwali. Why? Because the bus fares had almost doubled and he saved that money to pay his hostel bills that month.""It hurts the most when you cannot even enjoy the small pleasures of life, just because you do not have enough money.""As the rising cost of living continues to bite and with no relief in sight, families are making hard decisions about their futures too. Santa and her husband, married for three years now, were planning to buy a house in Bengaluru and start a family. But all plans have been shelved for now.

business,"Bank of England on heightened alert for further banking turmoilPublished2 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesThe Bank of England is on ""heightened"" alert for further turmoil in the banking sector, its governor has said.However, Andrew Bailey told MPs the recent problems facing lenders had not caused stress in the UK banking system.Officials have tried to calm investors since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed, sparking concerns about the stability of other lenders.In Europe, worries over the strength of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse led to a rushed takeover by rival UBS.Nerves among investors have sparked sharp falls in banking shares around the world. Mr Bailey told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the Bank of England would ""go on being vigilant"".He said we were in a period of ""very heightened, frankly, tension and alertness"".The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the biggest US banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis, and left depositors struggling to get their money out.The collapse was linked to recent rises in interest rates which had hit the value of SVB's assets. US regulators had to step in to protect customers, while the lender's UK arm was rescued by HSBC.Failed lender Silicon Valley Bank bought by rivalBank shares hit as investor nerves returnThe episode has generated heated debate in the US about whether SVB was subject to appropriate supervision and if officials responded properly to its collapse.At a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, financial regulators called the failure ""a textbook case of mismanagement,"" casting blame on SVB leaders for failing to adjust strategies as interest rates rose last year, despite warnings from officials. But they faced questions from senators who said the episode had also revealed failures in oversight.""It looks like regulators knew the problem but nobody dropped the hammer,"" said Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana.UK banking officials admitted to MPs that the speed of the SVB's collapse had taken them by surprise and may mean that banking rules may need updating.Mr Bailey said it was ""the fastest collapse from health to death"" since the UK's Barings Bank failed in 1995 after suffering heavy losses resulting from fraudulent investments.Sam Woods, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, noted that SVB UK saw about a third of its deposits - £3bn - withdrawn on one day.He twice suggested to the MPs that the stress tests applied to UK banks to make sure they can withstand a crisis would need to be looked at, given how new technology meant deposits could be withdrawn electronically in seconds.However, Mr Bailey told MPs he did not think the UK was in a position similar to the 2008 global financial crisis, when banks stopped lending to each other, plunging the world into a deep recession.He added that while rising interest rates were ""an issue"" for US banks, they were less likely to affect UK lenders because they were regulated differently.In the US the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Michael Gruenberg, said the SVB saga had shown the increased risk of bank runs at at a time when ""money can flow out of institutions with incredible speed in response to news amplified through social media channels"". He and other regulators in the US expressed support for strengthening banking rules, changes which some politicians such as Elizabeth Warren have championed.But stricter regulation is opposed by Republicans - reducing the chance of it happening.

technology,"Elon Musk among experts urging a halt to AI trainingPublished21 hours agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, AFPImage caption, Elon Musk is among those warning of the risks from advanced AIBy Chris VallanceTechnology reporterKey figures in artificial intelligence want training of powerful AI systems to be suspended amid fears of a threat to humanity.They have signed an open letter warning of potential risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control.Twitter chief Elon Musk is among those who want training of AIs above a certain capacity to be halted for at least six months.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and some researchers at DeepMind also signed.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, recently released GPT-4 - a state-of-the-art technology, which has impressed observers with its ability to do tasks such as answering questions about objects in images.The letter, from Future of Life Institute and signed by the luminaries, wants development to be halted temporarily at that level, warning in their letter of the risks future, more advanced systems might pose.""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" it says.The Future of Life Institute is a not-for-profit organisation which says its mission is to ""steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life"". This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: What is artificial intelligence?Mr Musk, owner of Twitter and chief executive of car company Tesla, is listed as an external adviser to the organisation.Advanced AIs need to be developed with care, the letter says, but instead, ""recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no-one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control"".The letter warns that AIs could flood information channels with misinformation, and replace jobs with automation.Is the world prepared for the coming AI storm?The letter follows a recent report from investment bank Goldman Sachs which said that while AI was likely to increase productivity, millions of jobs could become automated.However, other experts told the BBC the effect of AI on the labour market was very hard to predict. Outsmarted and obsoleteMore speculatively, the letter asks: ""Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete [sic] and replace us?""Stuart Russell, computer-science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a signatory to the letter, told BBC News: ""AI systems pose significant risks to democracy through weaponised disinformation, to employment through displacement of human skills and to education through plagiarism and demotivation.""And in the future, advanced AI's may pose a ""more general threat to human control over our civilization"". ""In the long run, taking sensible precautions is a small price to pay to mitigate these risks,"" Prof Russell added.But Princeton computer-science professor Arvind Narayanan accused the letter of focusing on ""speculative, futuristic risk, ignoring the version of the problem that is already harming people"".'Slow down'In a recent blog post quoted in the letter, OpenAI warned of the risks if an artificial general intelligence (AGI) were developed recklessly: ""A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do that, too.""Co-ordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important,"" the firm wrote.OpenAI has not publicly commented on the letter. The BBC has asked the firm whether it backs the call.Mr Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI - though he resigned from the board of the organisation some years ago and has tweeted critically about its current direction. Autonomous driving functions made by his car company Tesla, like most similar systems, use AI technology.The letter asks AI labs ""to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4"".If such a delay cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium, it says.""New and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI"" would also be needed. Recently, a number of proposals for the regulation of technology have been put forward in the US, UK and EU. However, the UK has ruled out a dedicated regulator for AI.Related TopicsElon MuskArtificial intelligenceMore on this storyUK rules out new AI regulator2 days agoAI could affect 300 million jobs - report2 days agoBill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decades21 MarchIs the world prepared for the coming AI storm?16 MarchView comments"
technology,"Elon Musk: Twitter boss announces blue tick shake-upPublished3 days agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesAnnabelle LiangBusiness reporterTwitter boss Elon Musk has announced a shake-up of the social media platform's paid Twitter Blue feature.From 15 April only verified subscribers will have posts recommended to other users and be allowed to vote in polls.Under the policy, posts from non-paying accounts will not be included in the ""For you"" stream of recommended tweets.Last week, the firm said it would remove the verified status of some ""legacy"" accounts, which date from before Mr Musk bought the firm.Users currently pay $7 (£5.70) a month for blue-tick verification, which also allows access to additional features.Mr Musk said the changes were ""the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over. It is otherwise a hopeless losing battle.""""Voting in polls will require verification for same reason,"" he added.In an earlier post, Mr Musk said paid verification significantly increases the cost of using bots and makes it easier to identify them.Skip twitter post by Elon MuskAllow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.Accept and continueThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by Elon MuskHowever, the move has been criticised by some social media users.A former worker on Twitter's verification team who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC: ""Our number one goal for my team was to protect users from real world harm and this screams the complete opposite to me.""""Verified users will use their power and their presence on the platform to influence anything from misinformation to actual harm for users all around the world. It's a silent threat that no one is seeing,"" they added.When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he was full of lofty ambitions about bringing back ""free speech"" .He wanted the platform to be ""maximally trusted"" and said this ""isn't a way to make money"".Yet Twitter policy now feels very different to those ideals.Realising that it was difficult to increase advertising revenue, Musk turned to a subscription based model.The sell initially was to give users a ""blue tick"" verification, if they paid a monthly fee.But the paying users didn't come in their droves. Stuck with flagging advertising revenue, and a stuttering subscription model - Musk has decided to take the nuclear option.There are two algorithms on Twitter - the ""For you"" stream of recommended tweets and stream of tweets from people you follow.Elon Musk's new policy will now essentially preclude non-paying users from taking part in one of those streams.It means unverified Twitter users will be far less likely to have their tweets liked or retweeted.Combined with Elon Musk's winding down of misinformation checks - this could be an extremely dangerous moment for Twitter.I've spoken to former employees who think this could be manna from heaven for trolls and people pushing misinformation.It also raises an existential question for Twitter. It was supposed to be fairly meritocratic place - with tweets rising by the quality of their content.It was a big part of Twitter's success. But now, that appears to have been swept away.Twitter Blue had a chaotic initial launch in November, as people started impersonating big brands and celebrities and paying for the blue tick badge in order to make them look authentic. Many pretended to be Mr Musk himself.This forced Twitter to pause the feature after less than a week, before it was relaunched the following month.Twitter Blue has since been used by controversial groups, including Taliban officials and their prominent supporters in Afghanistan.Verified users have their tweets amplified above other accounts. Subscribers also have access to additional features including an edit button, among other perks.Previously, the blue tick was used to indicate that high-profile accounts were authentic. It was given out by Twitter without a subscription fee - but only the firm itself decided who got one.Last week, Twitter said it would also start phasing out its ""legacy verified programme"" and remove some ""legacy verified checkmarks"" from 1 April.The firm added that users needed to pay to ""keep your blue checkmark on Twitter"".Bots on social media platforms can hurt their ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions.Mr Musk has often expressed concerns about how many fake or spam accounts are on Twitter. At one point he put his $44bn plan to buy the social media platform on hold as he queried the number of bots disclosed by the firm's previous management team.Related TopicsSocial mediaElon MuskTwitterMore on this storyTwitter says parts of source code leaked online4 days agoMeta exploring plans for Twitter rival10 MarchMusk apologises to Twitter worker over online row8 MarchTaliban start buying blue ticks on Twitter16 JanuaryView comments"

But at the same time, it has also become the first country to do the same for all ""recreational"" apps - including:NetflixInstagramCandy CrushTwitterThe ban, monitored by France's cyber-security agency, will affect about 2.5 million civil servants.""Recreational applications do not deliver sufficient levels of cyber-security and data protection to be deployed on administration's digital tools,"" Civil Service Minister Stanislas Guerini said.""These applications may therefore constitute a risk to the data protection of these administrations and their public officials."" Although, exceptions could be granted for ""institutional communications"" purposes.So it looks like France, unlike the rest of the West, is viewing Chinese and American technology companies in a similar way. Although, it is not the first instance of technology tension between the US and France.In 2019, France approved a digital-services tax despite threats of retaliation by the US, who argued it unfairly targeted American technology giants such as Google and Facebook.And since 2018, France has been vocally opposed to the US Cloud Act, which gives American law-enforcement authorities the power to request data stored by most major cloud providers, even if it is outside the US.France has had a prominent voice in the Gaia-X project - set up to:address the conflict between the US Cloud Act and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)set European cloud standards ensure customers' data is stored and processed in Europe, ""immune"" from non-European lawsDay after day, governments and public bodies are banning TikTok from staff devices - but France's decision to clamp down on all ""recreational apps"" stands out and is being praised by privacy campaigners.Fears about TikTok have reached fever pitch - but alongside the furore, people are beginning to question the privacy practices of other apps too - regardless of where the companies are based.

technology,"Google faces new multi-billion advertising lawsuitPublished2 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, AFPBy Chris VallanceTechnology reporterA lawsuit has been filed against Google to seek £3.4bn ($4.2bn) in compensation for publishers for lost revenue.The claim, by ex-Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur, alleges Google unlawfully used a dominant position in online adverts in a way that reduced what publishers could make from them.Google said it would fight the ""speculative and opportunistic"" action vigorously.It is the second such lawsuit, after a similar case was launched in November.That was brought by former Ofcom director Claudio Pollack, who is looking for up to £13.6bn in damages from the tech giant.The cases concern advertising technology - adtech - that decides in a fraction of a second which online adverts consumers will see, how much they will cost, and how much publishers will earn.Online display advertising is the main source of income for many websites.Google faces €25bn legal action in UK and the EUThe UK competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), is also investigating Google's dominance in advertising technology. In the lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday, Mr Arthur claims that because of Google's abuse of its position, the prices of adtech services were inflated, and ad sales revenues of publishers were unlawfully reduced. ""The CMA is currently investigating Google's anti-competitive conduct in adtech, but they don't have the power to make Google compensate those who have lost out. We can only right that wrong through the courts, which is why I am bringing this claim,"" he wrote.Collective claimsBoth legal claims ask the court - the Competition Appeal Tribunal -  to certify their claims as ""opt-out"", meaning every relevant publisher would be automatically included in the case unless they choose otherwise.These are collective claims, often referred to as a class action in the United States, which only became possible in the UK in 2015. Because they are brought on behalf of a whole group or class, the damages can be very large.Unless Mr Arthur and Mr Pollack agree to collaborate, the tribunal will have to decide which one should lead the collective claimMany competitorsGoogle told the BBC its advertising tools, ""and those of our many adtech competitors, help millions of websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers"".Although the CMA found that Google owned the largest provider in three key areas of adtech, the firm maintains it has many competitors. It also says its adtech fees are lower than, or match, industry averages.But in a case launched in January, the US Justice department accused Google of being an ""industry behemoth"" that had ""corrupted legitimate competition in the adtech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers"".On Tuesday, Google asked a court to dismiss the case - arguing that the US government had overstated its hold on the market. In 2021 the French competition regulator, Autorité de la concurrence, fined Google €220m for favouring its own services in the online advertising sector.

sports,"Man City v Liverpool: Danny Murphy on Jurgen Klopp's huge eight daysBy Danny MurphyFormer Liverpool midfielderLast updated on 5 hours ago5 hours ago.From the section LiverpoolThis is going to be a monumental week for Liverpool, but the fact they face three huge tests in quick succession might actually be exactly what they need.Starting on Saturday, the Reds play Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal in the space of eight days and I think they need to win at least two of those games to stay in the fight for the top four.That looks like a daunting prospect - but it might surprise a few people to see that Liverpool have not just done well in these big games this season, they've done better than any of the other top teams.When you include the top six's results against Champions League quarter-finalists Chelsea, Liverpool are still top of their mini-league, on goal difference. They drew at Anfield in January, while City and Arsenal have both beaten the BluesTo see Jurgen Klopp's side top of this mini-table did not shock me, though - it actually backs up my theory about their struggles this season, and why they have not got close to mounting a title challenge.At the start of the campaign, it felt like Liverpool had a little bit of a hangover from missing out on two of the big trophies last May. That was understandable, because they were two games from greatness last season. They were one Premier League win and the Champions League final away from a quadruple and doing what no team had done before in English football.More of a concern for me back in August was that a lot of the Liverpool players did not have real competition for their places. Watching their early performances, I felt complacency set in a little bit, especially against the lesser teams.Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier used to talk to me about it a lot when he was in charge at Anfield, when he would always warn us about what he called the comfort zone.He'd say that's what players fall into when they start believing their own hype and think they are a better team than they are.It's not a conscious decision you make as a player, sitting at home watching video clips of yourself then walking out on the pitch thinking you are going to be brilliant. However, when you have been part of a good team for a long time, you can fall into a trap where you end up just thinking you need to turn up to win.It's why all the best teams down the years have needed reinvention. Sir Alex Ferguson did it time and time again at Manchester United. Pep Guardiola is the same at City now - he knows you have to keep changing things to continue being successful.Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsGet Liverpool news notificationsListen to the latest The Red Kop podcastLiverpool are still capable of magic momentsLiverpool's last league game saw them follow up their 7-0 win over Manchester United with a 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth, who were then bottom of the table. ""That summed up their season so far,"" says MurphyIn years gone by under Klopp, the Reds would run straight through lesser opposition, and win game after game. Not this season, though. Liverpool have not been near those levels most of the time and everyone has been trying to explain why they have under-performed and looked so vulnerable defensively.There is more to it than just complacency - injures have not helped and, as the season has gone on, I've also seen a lack of confidence from them in certain games which comes from not getting the expected results earlier on.But the fact they have still done so well against the better teams confirms to me it has been more of a mind-set issue than a physical problem or a lack of quality.Chelsea are ranked 10/15 from games against the top five this season, with no wins and just two draws (and three goals) from six games. Fulham are bottom, with eight defeats out of eightWhenever you play the big teams, you are always very aware you have to be bang at it, physically and mentally, otherwise you are not going to be successful. When Liverpool have had that focus, they've got results. They have not just got the best record from those games between the top six, they've also picked up more points from the top five than anyone below them too.That's because if they play well they are more capable of hurting the top sides than anyone else, and they have proved that time and time again.Their second-half capitulation against Real Madrid at Anfield was worrying but they had started so well against the champions of Europe - and they are also one of the few teams to have beaten Napoli this season.In the Premier League, they have beaten City, they have smashed United and they have beaten Newcastle home and away - no-one else has managed that. They've definitely not become a bad team overnight.Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates after scoring the winner in the league game against Manchester City in October. He also scored when the Reds beat City 3-1 at Wembley in the Community Shield in August and was on target again when City won 3-2 at Etihad Stadium in the Carabao Cup in DecemberLiverpool's Premier League results against the top five in 2022-23HomeTeamAway9 AprilArsenalLost 3-2Won 1-0Man City1 AprilWon 7-0Man UtdLost 2-130 AprilTottenhamWon 2-1Won 2-1NewcastleWon 2-0Will City and Arsenal fear the Reds?Liverpool won't really care who wins the title now because they are thinking about themselves and making the top four, but they have a big say in who becomes champions.Apart from when City and Arsenal play each other, Liverpool are the most dangerous opponents they have left. They could even take points off both of them.Arsenal's remaining Premier League fixturesHomeAwayLeeds (1 April)Liverpool (9 April)Southampton (21 April)West Ham (16 April)Chelsea (29 April)Man City (26 April)Brighton (13 May)Newcastle (6 May)Wolves (28 May)Nottingham Forest (20 May)There are times when City are just breathtaking, but equally there have been certain games quite recently where they have not been as smooth or easy on the eye as in previous seasons.I still think going to Etihad Stadium and winning is a big ask - Liverpool have not done that in the league since Pep Guardiola arrived at City in 2016 - but if Mohamed Salah plays as well as he did in the 7-0 win against United, it won't be easy for Nathan Ake to stop him.Erling Haaland can win games for City on his own but it would give a very different perspective to that fixture if he does not recover from his groin injury in time.Man City's remaining Premier League fixturesHomeAwayLiverpool (1 April)Southampton (8 April)Leicester (15 April)Fulham (30 April)Arsenal (26 April)Everton (13 May)West Ham (3 May)Brentford (28 May)Leeds (7 May)Brighton (TBC)Chelsea (20 May)Even if Haaland does play, this Liverpool team has competed directly with City for several years now and there have been so many close games between them in that time that I don't think there will be much in it, regardless.The Arsenal players do not really have the same historic personal rivalry with Liverpool as City do but, while I don't think the Gunners will fear their trip to Anfield, they don't know what it is like to go there and win. Mikel Arteta was playing for Arsenal the last time that happened, in September 2012.Top four or not, Liverpool need a refreshChampions League is 'the' competition, we want to be part of it - KloppThis could be an amazing week for Liverpool but, whatever happens, it will be pivotal - not just to make or break their season but to decide what they do in the summer too.Lose all three games and their top-four hopes are over, which would quickly confirm to the owners they have a lot of work to do.But if they can stay in the race for the Champions League places and sneak in at the last minute, like they did in 2021, there's a chance Klopp may not get the same backing in the transfer market as he would if they don't get in.I don't know that, but it does seem logical in some respects and I've seen it happen at my old clubs before - it's one of the reasons Mark Hughes left Fulham in 2011, because he was promised money for players after a poor first half to the season but that was then reduced after we finished the season strongly.I am sure Liverpool's owners aren't naive enough to think they can get away with not investing in the squad in the summer, even if they do make the top four, but if that happens there could be a train of thought that the run-in proved the squad is actually pretty good and the team is back on track.So, this is something of a bitter-sweet situation for Liverpool fans. They will want to win all their games, because they want Champions League football and everything that it brings, but they want a refresh too - and I think they need one.I know a lot of supporters are confident that, with some investment, Klopp can get this team back to the top and fighting for the title again. I feel the same way - we've already seen them bounce back once, after their poor title defence in 2021. This is hopefully just another bump in the road but, looking at the money their rivals are spending, Klopp will definitely need some reinforcements if he is going to push this team on again.Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.Our coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content"

Leeds United (14th, 26pts)Leeds United only stayed up on the final day of last season and are in another relegation battle in 2022-23. With matches still to come against Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham, it could go down to the wire again.Jesse Marsch was sacked as manager in February with the club on a seven-game winless run but Javi Gracia has made an encouraging start with wins over Southampton and Wolves as well as a draw with Brighton in three of his first four league games in charge.Still to play: 1 Apr Arsenal (a), 4 Apr Nottingham Forest (h), 9 Apr Crystal Palace (h), 17 Apr Liverpool (h), 22 Apr Fulham (a), 25 Apr Leicester (h), 30 Apr Bournemouth (a), 7 May Manchester City (a), 13 May Newcastle (h), 20 May West Ham (a), 28 May Tottenham (h)Gracenote fact: Leeds United are the only one of the relegation candidates to have won two of their past four matches.

Only five of the top seven plus Chelsea have conceded fewer goal attempts this season than West Ham's 309.Bournemouth (19th, 24pts)Bournemouth were the first top-flight team to sack their manager this season with Scott Parker, who got them promotion last season, dismissed after criticising the club's summer recruitment following a Premier League record-equalling 9-0 loss at Liverpool in August.Gary O'Neil has been their manager since, firstly on an interim basis before getting the job permanently in November. The Cherries did not win any of their first seven league matches following the World Cup but victories over Wolves and a 1-0 success over Liverpool have given them hope.Six of Bournemouth's remaining matches are against other teams in this relegation fight but four of those games are away.Still to play: 1 Apr Fulham (h), 4 Apr Brighton (h), 8 Apr Leicester (a), 15 Apr Tottenham (a), 23 Apr West Ham (h), 27 Apr Southampton (a), 30 Apr Leeds (h), 6 May Chelsea (h), 13 May Crystal Palace (a), 20 May Manchester United (h), 28 May Everton (a)Gracenote fact: Bournemouth have conceded 15 goals from corners in this season's Premier League, nearly twice as many as the next worst team at defending corners, Chelsea (eight). On average, Bournemouth concede a goal from every 13 corners they face.Southampton (20th, 23pts)Southampton are another side on their third manager of the season after they sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl in November. He was replaced by Nathan Jones, but he only lasted eight Premier League matches and picked up one win before he was also dismissed.Ruben Selles, assistant manager under Hasenhuttl, was next in line and started with a 1-0 victory at Chelsea. A win against Leicester and draws with Manchester United and Tottenham have given Saints fans some hope.However, half of Southampton's remaining 10 matches are against the top seven teams, ending the season with a home game against Liverpool.Still to play: 2 Apr West Ham (a), 8 Apr Manchester City (h), 15 Apr Crystal Palace (h), 21 Apr Arsenal (a), 27 Apr Bournemouth (h), 30 Apr Newcastle (a), 8 May Nottingham Forest (a), 13 May Fulham (h), 20 May Brighton (a), 28 May Liverpool (h).Gracenote fact: Southampton have kept fewer clean sheets this season than any other team in the Premier League.

A grand jury has voted to indict him after investigating a $130,000 pay-out to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to buy her silence over an alleged affair. Mr Trump, 76, denies wrongdoing. He is the first serving or former US president to face a criminal charge.The office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has been pursuing the investigation, confirmed that it had contacted Mr Trump's attorney to ""co-ordinate his surrender"" on unspecified charges.The ex-president, who lives in Florida, is expected to fly to New York on Monday and be arraigned in court on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The charges in the indictment will be read to him at the hearing, which is set to last about 10-15 minutes.The United States Secret Service - which is tasked with protecting serving and former US presidents - will be in charge of security for the court appearance.Live updates on the indictmentThis is what will happen when Trump is arrestedWhat happened between Stormy Daniels and Trump?In 2016, adult film star Stormy Daniels contacted media outlets offering to sell her account of what she said was an adulterous affair she had with Donald Trump in 2006 - the year after he married his current wife, Melania.Mr Trump's team got wind of this, and his lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to Ms Daniels to keep quiet. This is not illegal.However, when Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer, the record for the payment says it was for legal fees. Prosecutors say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, which is a misdemeanour - a criminal offence - in New York.Prosecutors could also potentially allege that this breaks election law, because his attempt to hide his payments to Ms Daniels were motivated by not wanting voters to know he had an affair with her. Covering up a crime by falsifying records would be a felony, which is a more serious charge. Even advocates for prosecution acknowledge that either way, this is by no means a clear-cut case.There is little precedent for such a prosecution, and past attempts to charge politicians with crossing the line between campaign finance and personal spending have ended in failure.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Trump's 'perp walk' moment explained in 60 secondsMr Trump now faces the prospect of having his fingerprints recorded and his mugshot taken, like all defendants in criminal cases. In a statement, Mr Trump lashed out at the Manhattan district attorney. He called the prosecutor a ""disgrace"", and accused him of ""doing Joe Biden's dirty work"".""The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to 'Get Trump,' but now they've done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant Election Interference,"" he said.Mr Trump has repeatedly slammed the investigation in his hometown of New York as a political ""witch hunt"" led by his opponents. Mr Bragg, who is a registered Democrat, has denied pursuing a political vendetta against Mr Trump. ""We evaluate cases in our jurisdiction based on the facts, the law, and the evidence,"" he tweeted earlier this month.How big are Trump's legal problems?Profile: The prosecutor in Trump's hush money caseWhat is a US grand jury?Mr Trump's lawyer, Susan Necheles, said in a statement: ""He did not commit any crime. We will vigorously fight this political prosecution in court.""Following the indictment, Ms Daniels thanked her supporters. ""I have so many messages coming in that I can't respond... also don't want to spill my champagne,"" she tweeted.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Mr Trump denies having an affair with Stormy Daniels (pictured)The criminal case could shape the 2024 presidential race. Mr Trump is currently the front-runner among all declared and potential contenders for the Republican White House nomination.But there is nothing in US law that prevents a candidate who is found guilty of a crime from campaigning for, and serving as, president - even from prison.His campaign sent out fundraising emails on Thursday evening, citing the indictment.Top congressional Republicans are rallying behind Mr Trump.The BBC's Americast team discuss what next for TrumpHouse of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy said: ""Alvin Bragg has irreparably damaged our country in an attempt to interfere in our Presidential election.""As he routinely frees violent criminals to terrorize the public, he weaponized our sacred system of justice against President Donald Trump.""But Democrats welcomed the indictment, arguing it showed no-one was above the law.Congressman Adam Schiff said: ""The indictment and arrest of a former president is unique throughout all of American history. ""But so too is the unlawful conduct for which Trump has been charged.""Mr Trump is also being investigated in several other cases.They include probes into his role in the US Capitol riot of January 2021, his efforts to overturn his loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 election, and his handling of classified documents after leaving office.Mr Trump - who served as president from 2017-21 - was twice impeached by the House of Representatives.

Mr Yousaf's first FMQs session was hit by a series of disruptions from climate activists.The public gallery in the Holyrood chamber was eventually cleared after the session had to be suspended five times in the first 15 minutes. The presiding officer later announced tougher action against the protesters.Police later confirmed that 11 people had been removed from the public gallery but no-one was arrested.Such interruptions have been an almost weekly occurrence during recent FMQs.Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone has pledged to take action to stop them, with mobile phones already having been banned in the gallery. She later said there would be ""more stringent measures"" to identify those responsible, and a change to the parliament's visitor policy which would ban those individuals from the public gallery for six months. Robison replaces Kate Forbes in new Scottish cabinetWho is Humza Yousaf, Scotland's new first ministerThe first suspension of proceedings came before Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross had even managed to ask his first question to Mr Yousaf, who was sworn in as Nicola Sturgeon's successor as first minister on Wednesday.There were then a series of further interruptions during Mr Ross's exchanges with Mr Yousaf, with the presiding officer eventually calling on police and court officials to remove the public from the gallery.Ms Johnstone said: ""I don't think I can adequately express my deep regret that such action is required in our national parliament.

Mr Ross blasted the protesters, saying: ""This shower have been doing this week after week, and the image of genuine constituents being forced out of our parliament is one we will all regret and one none of us want to see repeated.""He said he was grateful that schoolchildren had been permitted to remain, but added: ""We must do something to stop this going forward.""Protests have become a regular feature of FMQs in recent months, but today might have been a new record with FIVE inside the first set of questions.Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone told MSPs that there are plans to try to crack down on this.But they chiefly consist of banning the use of mobile phones in the chamber and it is not clear if they will have a decisive effect.Indeed given the protests consist entirely of people shouting, it's difficult to think of a foolproof method to actually prevent them.The public gallery has been cleared for today.The absolute last resort would be to bar people from sitting there at all - something which the parliamentary authorities will be loathe to consider, given that transparent scrutiny is the whole point of Holyrood.The session followed three days of ceremony and procedure since Mr Yousaf's election as SNP leader on Monday. He won the backing of the majority of MSPs to become first minister on Tuesday before being sworn in at the Court of Session on Wednesday. He has named a nine-strong cabinet team, with his new deputy Shona Robison taking over the finance brief from Kate Forbes. Six of the nine cabinet members are women and there are five members under 40.Ms Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in the leadership contest, turned down a move from finance secretary to rural affairs - which would generally be seen as a demotion - and is now sitting as a backbench MSP.Mr Yousaf's appointments came under fire from Mr Ross, who described his team as a ""cabinet of lackeys"".Mr Ross pointed out that key ministerial posts relating to tourism and social security were abolished while Mr Yousaf had appointed a new minister for independence.""It's the same old from the SNP, another nationalist leader, when Scotland needs a national leader,"" he told the chamber.And he questioned whether having a minister for independence was a priority for the people of Scotland.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Mr Yousaf has been criticised by some within his own party over his choice of cabinet membersMr Yousaf said he made no apology for having a minister focused on independence, saying it was now more important than ever for Scotland to leave the UK.In his question to Mr Yousaf, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar focused on Scotland's mental health crisis, saying that more than 11,000 children and young people waited more than the 18-week standard and over 14,000 had referrals rejected entirely.Mr Yousaf said Mr Sarwar did not acknowledge the global impact of the Covid pandemic, but offered an apology and ""deep regret"" for anyone who had to wait longer than they should.He added that the Scottish government was taking action on recovery and the number of children starting treatment in the most recent quarter was the highest figure on record.The first minister said the overall mental health treatment waiting lists for young people had decreased by about 777, while the number of children waiting more than 18 weeks had dropped by 1,110.He added that there had been a 41.9% drop in the number waiting more than 52 weeks.Related TopicsScottish ParliamentHumza Yousaf"

She was sentenced to carry out 270 hours of community service. The charge stated that she had failed to self-isolate and had ""exposed people to risk of infection, illness and death"".Who is Margaret Ferrier?MP Margaret Ferrier faces Parliament probeMP who exposed public to Covid must do unpaid workCovid MP says she behaved 'out of character'MPs will vote on whether or not to follow the recommendations of the committee - and would generally back its suggested punishment.Any MP suspended from the Commons for at least 10 days can be recalled and a by-election held if at least 10% of the registered voters in their constituency sign a petition calling for it to happen. Labour would have high hopes of winning any by-election in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency. Ferrier had a majority of 5,230 at the last general election when she won it for the SNP, with Labour finishing second. She has been sitting in the Commons as an independent MP since losing the SNP whip. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Daniel Greenberg, began an investigation into her conduct on 12 October following Ferrier's self-referral.He concluded that she had put her own personal interest ahead of the public interest by not immediately self-isolating in London, and had therefore caused ""possible risk of harm to health and life for people she came into contact with"".The commissioner also said her actions had ""caused significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, and of its members generally"" and noted that people in many other walks of life would have been sacked for a similar breach of the lockdown rules.'Indication of remorse'Ferrier told the commissioner her self-referral was ""an open acceptance"" and an ""indication of remorse"" that she had brought Parliament into disrepute.But she maintains that she did not put her personal interest above that of the public. Glasgow Sheriff Court was told last August that she had taken a Covid test on Saturday 26 September 2020 because she had a ""tickly throat"".While awaiting her results, she went to church on the Sunday and gave a reading to the congregation, and later spent more than two hours in a bar in Prestwick, Ayrshire.She then travelled to London by train - which had 183 passengers on board - on the Monday and spoke in the Commons later that day before finding out a short time later that she had tested positive for the virus.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Margaret Ferrier campaigning with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon ahead of the 2019 General ElectionFerrier wore a face mask in the Commons, and after speaking in the chamber at about 19:30 had sat at a table with DUP MP Jim Shannon, where they conversed for 20 minutes.The positive result from the test was delivered to her shortly after 20:00, by both text and email.The MP decided to get a train back to Glasgow the following day, fearing she would have to self-isolate in a London hotel room for two weeks.New SNP leader Humza Yousaf called on Ferrier to quit as an MP and said he would look forward to fighting a by-election in her constituency. He added: ""We've said from day one that Margaret Ferrier should have stepped down because of her reckless action.""We'll take nothing for granted, we won't be complacent. We've got strong support in Rutherglen and right across that region but it will take hard work"". Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said said it was right that Parliament had ""thrown the book"" at Ferrier, and said the SNP still had questions to answer on what they knew and what they did at the time.""Ferrier should do the right thing and stand down as an MP. Her constituents deserve better and that means a by-election"", he said.The recall process has only been used three times in the past.In the first instance - a petition against DUP MP Ian Paisley in 2018 - the 10% threshold was not met.However, it was met in the other two cases, against Labour MP Fiona Onasanya and Tory Chris Davies in 2019. Ms Onasanya did not contest the by-election in her seat, while Mr Davies stood in the by-election and lost.The rules of the House of Commons mean that if an MP is suspended for 10 sitting days, a recall petition can be opened in their constituency.The petition is open for six weeks, and if 10% of voters in the area sign it, it will trigger a by-election.So there are a few hoops to jump through - the suspension is still to be approved by MPs, and given the ongoing parliamentary proceedings against Boris Johnson there is fierce debate about what sanctions should be applied for Covid rule breaches.Ms Ferrier also has the right to appeal the committee's decision.But it still seems likely there will be a by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West - a seat which has changed hands at the last three general elections.Ms Ferrier won it for the SNP with a majority of 9.7% in 2019, but it was already a key target for Labour.An early contest would be an immediate test for the SNP leader Humza Yousaf - and also for Labour counterparts Sir Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, in their quest to spark a revival in former Scottish heartlands.Related TopicsHouse of CommonsRutherglenMargaret FerrierUK ParliamentMore on this storyWho is Margaret Ferrier?13 September 2022MP Margaret Ferrier faces Parliament probe18 October 2022MP who exposed public to Covid must do unpaid work13 September 2022Covid MP says she behaved 'out of character'11 October 2020"

Her departure came hours after the new SNP leader was confirmed as Scotland's first minister after a vote in the Scottish Parliament.The post she was offered by Mr Yousaf would be seen as a major demotion.Ms Forbes later tweeted that Mr Yousaf had her ""full support"" and said: ""I have full confidence he will appoint a talented cabinet and ministerial team, able to meet the challenges facing the country.""She had been on maternity leave from her role when Nicola Sturgeon resigned as first minister and SNP leader last month. Profile: Who is Kate Forbes?Yousaf confirmed as Scotland's new first ministerShona Robison to be Scottish deputy first ministerMr Yousaf was elected as first minister after being backed by his own MSPs and the Scottish Greens, which guaranteed him a majority over the opposition party leaders.He becomes Scotland's youngest first minister, at the age of 37, and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Mr Yousaf to congratulate him on Tuesday.Ms Forbes had launched a highly-personal attack on Mr Yousaf during the SNP leadership contest when she questioned whether he was capable of being first minister during a live STV debate.

Her beliefs as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland also clash with those of the Scottish Greens, who had threatened to walk away from their power-sharing agreement with the SNP if she had won the contest.Speaking shortly after being confirmed as the new first minister on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Yousaf said he had spoken to Ms Forbes and ""absolutely"" wanted her to remain in government - but it was not known at that stage what role she had been offered or whether she would accept. Mr Yousaf narrowly defeated Ms Forbes by 26,032 votes to 23,890 to become SNP leader on Monday after a contest that exposed deep divisions within the party. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Humza Yousaf defeated Kate Forbes in the leadership contestThe result was closer than many people expected, and showed that Ms Forbes has considerable support among grassroots SNP members despite Mr Yousaf being backed by the party hierarchy. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice has said Ms Forbes appeared to be more popular than Mr Yousaf with Scottish voters as a whole. Ms Forbes congratulated Mr Yousaf after he was confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday, saying: ""Whatever the robust disagreements or frank exchanges of the last few weeks, I am confident we will unite behind Humza as our new party leader in the shared and common objective of independence"".The pair also embraced in the Scottish Parliament chamber after the vote that saw him also appointed as the country's sixth first minister.Following the vote, Mr Yousaf announced that Shona Robison - who has been serving as the social justice secretary and was a close ally of Ms Sturgeon - would be appointed as his deputy first minister.Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said Mr Yousaf had ""poured petrol on the SNP civil war"".Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Nicola Sturgeon tendered her resignation as first minister in a letter to the King""Kate Forbes' furious snub to his offer of a cabinet demotion shows his mission to reunite their feuding party is doomed to failure,"" he said.""It makes a mockery of his claim only yesterday that: 'We are no longer team Humza, or team Ash, or team Kate, we are one team.' The reality is the SNP are divided from top to bottom.""In his conversation with the new first minister on Tuesday, the prime minister is said to have reiterated his desire to ""continue working constructively with the Scottish government"".After his victory, Mr Yousaf promised he would ""argue tirelessly for independence""He raised the question of an independence referendum during their call, but Mr Sunak suggested this would ""distract"" from ""delivering on the things that are top of the priority list for people across Scotland"".Earlier in the day, Nicola Sturgeon officially tendered her resignation as Scotland's first minister in a letter to the King.This is a big setback for Humza Yousaf's efforts to reunite the SNP after a bruising leadership contest in which Kate Forbes ran him close. On Monday, he appealed for the party to come together as ""one team"" and to quickly heal the divisions that opened up in the campaign. Today he told me he ""absolutely"" wanted Kate Forbes in government but within a couple of hours she had turned down his offer to move to rural affairs. That would have been a demotion from finance but those close to Humza Yousaf say it was a genuine offer informed by earlier indications from Kate Forbes. Allies of Kate Forbes say she has had to consider whether or not she could effect real change in Mr Yousaf's government. She will also have weighed up whether serving in his team would help or hinder her prospects should there be another leadership contest in the coming years.Related TopicsKate ForbesHumza Yousaf"
health,"Blood tests may spare cancer patients chemoPublished1 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage caption, Ben Cooke avoided chemo thanks to the blood testsBy Fergus WalshMedical editor A blood test which can detect traces of cancer cells could spare thousands of patients unnecessary chemotherapy every year.A major bowel cancer trial is examining whether the test can show if surgery has removed all of the tumour.Doctors say half of patients with stage 3 bowel cancer are cured by surgery alone so by using chemotherapy they are over-treating many people. About 1,600 bowel cancer patients are being recruited to the UK study.Ben Cooke runs a hair salon on the King's Road in Chelsea, London, and also works as a stylist for fashion shoots. In early March last year, he noticed some dark blood in his poo. He rang NHS 111 and was sent to A&E. He was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer, which was successfully treated with surgery.  The gold standard treatment is to then have intravenous chemotherapy to mop up any remaining tumour cells and reduce the risk of the cancer returning.  But the chemotherapy used in bowel cancer, oxaliplatin, can cause painful tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, called peripheral neuropathy.This nerve damage can be long-term, and Ben was worried it might affect his ability to do the job he loves.   ""I would not be able to cope with that,"" he says. ""I need to work - it's my therapy.""The 52-year-old enrolled in a study at London's Royal Marsden Hospital, which is evaluating whether a blood test can show if chemo is really needed. His test showed he was clear of cancer, so he avoided intravenous chemotherapy.Instead, like everyone taking part in the trial, he took an oral chemo tablet twice a day. This had minimal side effects and allowed him to carry on working.  ""The fact that I didn't have any tingling in my hands has just been an absolute blessing,"" he says.Image caption, Ben's blood is extracted for the liquid biopsyThe blood tests work by looking for microscopic traces of cancer in the bloodstream called circulating tumour DNA. The presence of these markers indicates whether the patient has been cured by their surgery or not. Such tiny fragments would be invisible on a scan. Ben's consultant at the Marsden, Dr Naureen Starling, is the principal investigator on the trial. She says the outcome could affect the way thousands of bowel cancer patients are treated every year.""Half of patients with stage 3 bowel cancer are cured by surgery alone, so we are over-treating a large proportion of patients,"" she says.The hope is that this specialised technology could spare many cancer patients unnecessary chemotherapy.""That's good for the patient, it's good for the health service, it's good for cost savings within the NHS. That would be a win-win,"" says Dr Starling.Image caption, The liquid biopsies being packaged to send to CaliforniaThe trial, called TRACC, is using a test created by US company Guardant Health. The samples are sent to their labs in California for analysis with the results coming back within around two weeks. Survival outcomesThe trial, funded by the National Institute for Health & Care Research (NIHR), will examine any difference in survival rates after three years between those patients whose treatment was guided by the blood test compared with the standard-of-care chemotherapy group.Trials are also under way in the UK to monitor patients with lung and breast cancer in the same way.Dr Starling says the potential for this new technology across cancer care is ""immense"", not just when it comes to detecting residual disease after surgery, but also for early diagnosis.What is clear already, from multiple studies, is that so-called ""liquid biopsy"" blood tests can reveal the lingering presence of cancer long before it would be found using traditional methods. A trial in Greece published in Nature in January, found that liquid biopsies could show cancer recurrence at least four years before it would be detectable via a scan. That study followed a small group of breast cancer patients after surgery.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago last June, a study in 455 bowel cancer patients found that by using the blood tests to guide treatment, the number of patients needing post-surgery chemotherapy was nearly halved without the risk of relapse.But Dr Starling says the far bigger randomised trial in the UK is essential to calibrate exactly how much reliance can be placed on liquid biopsies, especially when it means considering the withdrawal of chemotherapy.The tests have already been available to private patients. Susanne Winter, an artist from Surrey, was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer in March 2022 and had successful surgery to remove the tumour and some cancerous lymph nodes. She initially thought she would need chemotherapy to ensure the cancer was entirely gone, but she had the ctDNA test done privately which showed she was clear of cancer.Susanne, 58, had cancelled all her commitments to prepare for several months of chemotherapy, but the negative test result meant she was free to concentrate on her art. She even had two works accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition.She feels incredibly lucky to have avoided chemotherapy. ""I knew how toxic it can be. You're psyching yourself up for it, so to hear that you aren't going to need it is just unbelievable,"" she says.Image caption, Susanne Winter was able to carry on paintingWhat is considered the holy grail of cancer detection is to be able to spot the disease at the very earliest stage, when it is most easy to cure.Blood tests are also being trialled to see if they can diagnose a whole range of cancers.More than 140,000 volunteers aged 50-77 have been recruited across England to see if the test could pick up more than 50 types of tumours, most of which have no screening programmes. The NHS-Galleri trial is made by Californian company Grail, and some interim results are due early next year.Related TopicsBowel cancerNHS"

In 2022, that number increased to 5,270 - a 40% rise.The procedure is designed to help women unhappy with the shape, weight or droop of their breasts by making them smaller and more lifted.

health,"Sniffing body odour is tested as an anxiety therapyPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Michelle RobertsDigital health editorSniffing other people's body odour might be useful in therapy for social anxiety, say Swedish researchers who have started tests with volunteers. The scientists have been using armpit sweat in their experiments. Their hunch is the smell activates brain pathways linked to emotions, offering a calming effect - but it is far too soon to say if they are right. They are presenting some of their early findings at a medical conference in Paris this week. Why and how do we smell?Babies are born with a strong sense of smell, with a preference for their mother and her breastmilk. Smell helps us humans sense danger - from food or a smoky fire, for example - and interact with our environment, as well as each other.It also makes meals more tasty and can evoke strong memories too. Aromas are detected by receptors in the upper part of the nose. Signals from these are then relayed directly to the limbic system, a brain region that is associated with memory and emotions.Can the right smell make you feel more productive?Parkinson's test - woman smelled disease on husbandSmell training to help Covid sufferersThe Swedish researchers suggest that human body odour might communicate our emotional state - happy or anxious, for instance - and even elicit similar responses in others who smell it.They asked volunteers to donate armpit sweat from when they were watching either a scary movie or a happy one. Next, 48 women with social anxiety agreed to sniff some of these samples, alongside receiving a more conventional therapy called mindfulness, where people are encouraged to focus on the here and now rather than replaying negative thoughts. Some of the women were given genuine body odour to sniff, while others - the control group - were given clean air instead. Those who were exposed to the sweat appeared to do better with the therapy.  Lead researcher Ms Elisa Vigna, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: ""Sweat produced while someone was happy had the same effect as someone who had been scared by a movie clip.  So there may be something about human chemo-signals in sweat generally which affects the response to treatment. ""It may be that simply being exposed to the presence of someone else has this effect, but we need to confirm this. In fact, that is what we are testing now in a follow-up study with a similar design, but where we are also including sweat from individuals watching emotionally neutral documentaries.""What is sweat and does it always smell? Most of the skin's sweat is odourless. But sweat glands in the armpit and groin produce certain compounds that cause body odour. Bacteria on the skin's surface and on nearby hair follicles break down these compounds, producing others which are responsible for the smell. Duncan Boak from the charity Fifth Sense, which aims to raise awareness about smell and taste disorders, said: ""We know there's a strong link between our sense of smell and our emotional wellbeing.""Losing the ability to smell other people, such as your partner and children can cause depression and feelings of isolation.  ""Whilst this is a preliminary study and further work is of course needed, it's very encouraging to see further research around the importance of our sense of smell to good mental health.""Related TopicsAnxietyMental healthMore on this storyCan the right smell make you more productive?12 July 2022Town's 'cheese-vomit' smell identified23 May 2022New generation of deodorant 'on the way'3 July 2018'Public toilets smell nice to me now'10 February 2021Smell training recommended for Covid recovery24 April 2021Related Internet LinksPOTION ProjectEuropean Congress of PsychiatryThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

Hundreds of people have died from the virus in recent years, almost all in Africa.What is the Marburg virus and how dangerous is it?According to the World Health Organization (WHO), on average, the Marburg virus kills half of the people it infects, with previous outbreaks killing between 24% and 88% of patients.The virus was first identified in 1967 after 31 people were infected and seven died in simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and Belgrade in Serbia. The outbreak was traced to African green monkeys imported from Uganda.   But the virus has since been linked to other animals. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Marburg virus was first traced to the African green monkeyAmong humans, it is spread mostly by people who have spent long periods in caves and mines populated by bats. In recent years, there have also been outbreaks of the Marburg virus in:  Equatorial GuineaGhanathe Democratic Republic of the CongoKenyaSouth AfricaUgandaZimbabweA 2005 outbreak in Angola killed more than 300 people.However, in the rest of the world, only two people have died from the Marburg virus in the past 40 years - one person in Europe and one in the US. Both had been on expeditions to caves in Uganda.Where have most cases been recorded?Five people have died in Tanzania's north-western Kagera region. Three other people are being treated in hospital and authorities are tracing 161 contacts. This follows an outbreak in Equatorial Guinea in February, which is known to have infected nine people and killed seven. The WHO is investigating 20 more probable cases there.Other major outbreaks include:2022, Ghana: three cases, two deaths2017, Uganda: three cases, three deaths2012, Uganda: 15 cases, four deaths2005, Angola: 374 cases, 329 deaths1998-2000, DR Congo: 154 cases, 128 deaths1967, Germany/Serbia: 31 cases, seven deathsWhat are the symptoms of the Marburg virus? The virus begins abruptly with:a feversevere headachemuscle painsThis is often followed, three days later, by:watery diarrhoeastomach painnausea vomitingAccording to the WHO, ""the appearance of patients at this phase has been described as showing 'ghost-like' drawn features, deep-set eyes, expressionless faces and extreme lethargy.""Many people go on to bleed from various parts of the body, and some die eight to nine days after first falling ill, because of extreme loss of blood and shock.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Egyptian rousette fruit bat is one of the main carriers of the virusHow is the Marburg virus spread?African green monkeys and pigs can carry it.The Egyptian rousette fruit bat often also harbours the virus.Among humans, it spreads through bodily fluids and contact with contaminated bedding.Even after people have recovered, their blood or semen can remain infectious for many months afterwards. How can it be treated?There are no specific treatments or a vaccine for the virus. But a range of blood products, drug and immune therapies are being developed, the WHO says.Doctors may be able to alleviate the symptoms by giving hospital patients plenty of fluids and using transfusions to replace lost blood.How can it be contained? People in Africa should avoid eating or handling bushmeat, according to Gavi, an international health organisation.People should also avoid contact with pigs in areas with an outbreak, says the WHO.Men who have had the virus should use condoms for a year after the onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative for the virus twice.Those who bury people who have died from the virus should also avoid touching the body.

""The government's lack of urgency on climate resilience is in sharp contrast to the recent experience of this country,"" she said.Over the last couple of years, England has faced a series of extreme weather events, likely made worse by climate change.Last year was the warmest on record for the UK - temperatures broke 40C for the first time and more than 25,000 wildfires broke out.Image source, Christopher FurlongImage caption, Sheffield was hit by wildfires last year as summer temperatures breached 40C in parts of EnglandAs well as extreme heat, rainfall has been consistently low for parts of south and southeast England, affecting crop yields.Andrew Blenkiron's 6,000-acre (24 sq km) farm in Thetford, Norfolk saw just 2.4mm of rain in February compared to the local average for that month of 43mm. He has now been forced to cut back on plans to plant potatoes, onions, parsnips and carrots by around a fifth.He said: ""Farmers are at the very forefront of climate change on a day-to-day basis... we are used to working with these issues, but we are concerned with the extremes we are now facing.""To cope with the impacts of extreme heat Mr Blenkiron has enlarged reservoirs on his farm and shifted harvesting patterns to prevent wildfires. But he said that farmers needed more money from government to implement their climate plans, especially if they involved new infrastructure projects like reservoirs.Image source, John Cottle / NFUImage caption, Andrew Blenkiron has adapted his farm to reduce emissions and lower the impact of climate changeA UK government spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have taken decisive action to improve the UK's climate change resilience - including investing a record £5.2bn into flood defences.""The spokesperson said the government would factor in the committee's recommendations to the new National Adaptation Plan, which is expected to be published this summer. The committee said the government needed to consider the resilience of farming systems in other countries. Nearly half of all the food the UK consumes is imported. The CCC said this makes all of the UK's food supply vulnerable to global weather patterns.Already this year supermarkets have placed limits on fruit and vegetable sales after bad weather in North Africa affected supply. The committee has recommended the government require all large food sector companies by law to assess the climate risks to their supply chains.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Climate change could lead to more empty supermarket shelvesThe committee reviewed the government's plans across 12 other areas - from buildings to transport to nature. They found that just five out of the 45 policy areas had fully credible climate change plans and none were making progress to improve climate resilience.The committee commended the government for updating building regulations last year for new domestic properties - requiring developers to take account of overheating. But they said this needed to be extended to cover all existing homes - as 80% of all homes that will be around in 2050 have already been built. As many as 4.6 million homes overheat, according to a recent survey, putting those with existing health conditions like asthma at risk. Internet at riskThe report singled out England's internet networks as being woefully unprepared for climate change despite their crucial importance.England's internet networks - made up of hundreds of data centres, and extensive networks of cables and masts - underpin the UK's service-based economy.This infrastructure is already at risk from extreme weather, including heat and strong winds during storms. In November 2021, Storm Arwen left one million British properties without power and internet supply. The committee found ""there was no visible plan by the industry or government, to manage long-term risk"".Image source, Ian ForsythImage caption, The UK's internet supply is at risk from extreme weather as shown during Storm ArwenMatt Evans, director of Markets at techUK, the UK's tech trade association, told the BBC the report showed there needed to be better collaboration across industry and government. But he said it ""doesn't fully capture the resiliency strategies employed by high-tech industries"".  The committee did praise local governments for innovative climate change preparation, including the work of Kent County Council to help farmers switch their crops to those that will fare better in warmer weather.But Baroness Brown said that central government needed to better support local adaptation plans by providing more funding and more region-specific information on future threats.Related TopicsDroughtUK heatwavesClimate changeMore on this storyFour ways climate change is affecting weather20 MarchUK costs from flood damage could rise by 20%7 MarchUK heatwave broke dozens of records, new data shows14 October 2022View comments"
climate,"Swiss court case ties human rights to climate changePublished2 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsClimate changeImage source, ReutersImage caption, Glaciers in the Alps are at particular risk of rising temperatures due to climate changeBy Imogen Foulkes & Adam DurbinBBC NewsMore than 2,000 women are taking the Swiss government to court claiming its policy on climate change is violating their right to life and health. The case is the first time the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) will hear a case on the impact of climate change on human rights.It follows six years of unsuccessful battles through the Swiss courts. Temperatures in Switzerland are rising faster than the global average and there are ever more frequent heatwaves. The Swiss women - who call themselves the Club of Climate Seniors and have an average age of 73 - say climate change is putting their human rights, their health and even their lives at risk. Their evidence to the court includes their medical records. They want the ECHR to order Switzerland to work harder at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the campaigners, Elisabeth Stern, told the BBC: ""Due to climate change, we have more heatwaves and older women suffer more. They die more often during these heatwaves than they otherwise would. ""Some people say, why are you complaining, you're going to die anyway. But we don't want to die just because our Swiss government has not been successful in coming up with a decent climate policy."" The European Climate and Health Observatory says that projected increases in average temperature are likely to have ""serious impacts on public health"" across Europe, particularly among elderly people.In the last 20 years, heat-related mortality in people older than 65 in Europe has increased by more than 30%, it says. The Swiss government does not deny that climate change can affect health - but says it cannot be tied specifically to older women's health. If the women are successful, the case could set a precedent for every one of the European court's 46 member states.World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100.According to the UN climate body, the IPCC, if global temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C, Europe will be vulnerable to flooding caused by extreme rainfall.Extreme temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires - as seen in Europe last summer. France and Germany recorded about seven times more land burnt between January and the middle of July 2022, compared with the average.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, World's largest ice rink closed due to lack of iceRelated TopicsHuman rightsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeEuropean Court of Human RightsClimate changeSwitzerlandMore on this storyUN releases 'survival guide' to avert climate disaster20 MarchA really simple guide to climate change17 MarchSnow shortage threatens Alps with wet winter season3 January"
climate,"UN climate report: Scientists release 'survival guide' to avert climate disasterPublished20 MarchShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCOP28Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met in Switzerland where glaciers are meltingBy Matt McGrath and Georgina Rannardin Interlaken and CardiffUN chief Antonio Guterres says a major new report on climate change is a ""survival guide for humanity"".Clean energy and technology can be exploited to avoid the growing climate disaster, the report says.But at a meeting in Switzerland to agree their findings, climate scientists warned a key global temperature goal will likely be missed.Their report lays out how rapid cuts to fossil fuels can avert the worst effects of climate change. Five things we've learned from new UN climate reportIn response to the findings, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres says that all countries should bring forward their net zero plans by a decade. These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.""There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,"" the report states.Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must ""work towards far more ambitious climate commitments"" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.""The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,"" a spokesperson said. Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: ""While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action."" A really simple guide to climate changeFour ways climate change is affecting weatherUS government approves Alaska Willow oil projectDrought risk to England regions after dry FebruaryThe report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. ""Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,"" the report states.""If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,"" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.""And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.""The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. What you can do to reduce carbon emissionsThe state of the climate in 2023What is carbon capture - and how can it fight climate change?And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. ""There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,"" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.Image source, IPCCImage caption, World-leading scientists wrote the UN report which must also be agreed on by governments""The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.""The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a ""temporary overshoot"". The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.Some observers have their doubts. ""We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,"" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. ""Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,"" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.Related TopicsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeCOP28COP26Climate change"
sports,"Premier League domestic flights: BBC Sport research shows 81 flights from 100 gamesBy David LockwoodEditorial Sustainability Lead, BBC SportLast updated on 23 March 202323 March 2023.From the section Premier Leaguecomments1981The 100 fixtures studied included 82 Premier League games, 13 FA Cup fixtures with the Premier League team playing away from home, and five EFL Cup matches. BBC Sport analysed data from Flightradar24, cross-referencing from the UK Sports Aviation twitter account.BBC Sport research has found evidence of 81 individual short-haul domestic flights made by Premier League teams to and from 100 matches during a two-month sample period this year.Whether it's Trent Alexander-Arnold on a flight back from Newcastle to Liverpool, Chelsea's Ben Chilwell flying from London to Leicester or Nottingham Forest players on their way from East Midlands Airport to Blackpool, occasional social media posts have so far been the only insight to inform the debate around Premier League clubs flying small distances to matches instead of travelling by road or rail.Now, a study of 100 games played in the UK involving Premier League teams between 19 January and 19 March 2023 has given the first insight into the volume of the controversial journeys, some as short as 27 minutes. And for the first time the study also shows details of 'positioning' flights - where near-empty planes are flown to convenient airports, sometimes across the UK, in order to then transport players and staff to fixtures.The Sports Desk podcast: Should Premier League clubs stop flying to domestic games?The study suggests: 81 individual domestic flights by Premier League clubs (including return journeys)Of those 81 flights, the breakdown was 59 flights for Premier League fixtures; 16 for FA Cup games and six for EFL Cup matchesThe shortest flight was just 27 minutes; the longest 77 minutesThe average duration of these 81 flights was 42 minutes.Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.BBC Sport contacted all Premier League clubs with the flight information.In addition to these 'player movement' flights, the research also suggested a significant number of connected 'positioning' flights. The study found: 37 of the 81 player flights had a flight marked as 'positioning' beforehandThe longest 'positioning' flight was 84 minutes; the shortest just 17 minutesThe average duration of the 37 'positioning' flights in the study was 42 minutesFlights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport, with short-haul flights the worst emitters, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Should clubs stop flying to domestic matches for environmental reasons?Find out more about sport and climate changeWhat about these 'positioning' flights?'Positioning' flights are where the plane is getting into position to pick up its private charter passengers. They are normally what the aviation industry calls ""empty leg"" flights - so without passengers and therefore qualify as 'ghost' flights, a term increasingly being used to describe any flight with fewer than 10% passengers. BBC Sport contacted the airlines involved but received no confirmation as to the number of passengers on these flights.As the Premier League's most southerly team, Bournemouth perhaps have more justification than others to fly to some games. They flew to Birmingham airport and back on the weekend of 17-18 March for their fixture with Aston Villa - a return journey totalling 73 minutes.But the data pointed towards a further four 'positioning flights' connected to this trip - three of which were to or from Scotland - totalling an additional 201 minutes.In addition to the 37 marked positioning flights, the BBC Sport research also observed instances of planes flying from one London airport to another in advance of a player flight - although not marked as 'positioning' flights. It is therefore possible the actual number could be higher.

The need to fly often depends on kick-off time, the time in between our matches and the reliability of alternative transport methods.""The biggest emissions are generated from stadiums on matchdays and fan travel - which is the sport's biggest climate footprint. The Premier League statement said its work will also include ""encouraging fans"" to ""consider how"" they can reduce their own carbon footprint.However, Dale Vince, chairman of League One side Forest Green, regarded as the world's most sustainable football team, called it ""shocking data in just two months"", adding: ""It's an illusion to think there is a gain for a flight of that duration, modern coaches are very comfortable and aren't going to impair the performance of the players over that short distance""Vince believes the Premier League and its clubs should lead the way.Vince said: ""The carbon impact is one thing… I think the bigger impact is the emotional one, the intellectual one, you've got Premier League teams setting a very bad example for the rest of the country... when we are desperately in need of getting to net zero. ""This comes just days after the latest UN report that says we absolutely have just a few years left to act to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.""The Premier League has signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework and as a result is tasked with reaching net zero by 2040. That was in November 2021 but it is yet to confirm its plans.The statement added: ""The Premier League is in the process of developing an environmental sustainability strategy, which will set out plans to deliver climate action. As part of this strategy, the league will continue to engage with and work alongside clubs and partners, to find practical ways of reducing football's environmental impact.""View more on twitterWhat are the factors?Premier League clubs have been travelling this way for years - generally the quickest and most convenient option which clubs argue gives players and staff maximum time to prepare and recover between games, when the global fixture schedule is increasingly packed - something the clubs have no control over.It is only recently, as players started to frequently post images on social media of these short domestic flights, that it attracted increased scrutiny in an era of climate impact awareness.As this season shows, competition in the Premier League is as fierce as ever - just four points separates the bottom nine teams as they scramble to stay in the division and reap the multi-million pound rewards.With such fine margins and enormous financial consequences, will clubs really risk a potential disadvantage by opting for slower but more environmentally friendly travel to high-stakes fixtures? Matt Konipinski is director of physio and performance at Rehab 4 Performance and has worked with Liverpool, Rangers and Barnsley football clubs. He disputes the performance argument, but does acknowledge that in a busy schedule time might be the overriding concern. He said: ""I think physical condition is a consideration but I think the mode of travel doesn't necessarily have a huge amount of scientific support to justify one versus the other.""We're talking about the options around whether a team might fly, whether a team may take the coach, whether a team may take the train and really the main emphasis around flying is speed and the top teams will prioritise speed over everything else.""View more on instagramThere is no previous flight information to compare season with season. However, clubs have told BBC Sport that this season the cost of chartering planes has almost doubled as a result of both the rise in the price of fuel and decreased availability of planes after the pandemic and Brexit. With pressure to spend money to attract better players, plus the increased focus on sustainability in the game, many clubs said the plane is the last resort - and that this 2022-23 season might actually see a reduction in flights from previous years. And that is despite running issues with England's rail network.external-linkChelsea manager Graham Potter gave an honest appraisal of the challenges facing football, saying: ""I think it's something we increasingly have to look at, because I think it's something we have to do better with. It's my personal opinion. That's not to say its straightforward because there are factors, but I think it's an area we can improve.""Nottingham Forest were one of the few clubs who shared their full flight data with BBC Sport and a spokesperson said they anticipated using flights in four of their 23 away fixtures this season and added: ""The club will always use rail or road travel unless there are overwhelming logistical and sporting reasons not to do so.""Many clubs reference fixture scheduling across multiple domestic and European competitions and then changes made by broadcasters with expensive TV rights - factors outside their control.An English Football Association statement added: ""Establishing a more environmentally sustainable approach across English football is very important, and we encourage everyone in the game to help play their part. It is the responsibility of each club to make their own operational travel choices across all competitions, including for Premier League, EFL and FA Cup matches.""Former QPR player Michael Doughty - now chief of sustainability at Swindon Town - told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I think there needs to be some legislation or some feedback from the Premier League around what is a distance of travel viable for flying, and also some feedback from the clubs around performance. ""We're assuming plane travel is optimising for performance, but I haven't seen any clear studies that have shown that.""Ben Chilwell, left, posting on Instagram on a flight with his Chelsea team-matesAnalysis: Why has BBC Sport done this research?What football does in this area matters because it is the world's most popular sport and has the potential to influence so many millions of people all over the world. The Premier League is not only the most popular domestic league in the world, it is also one of Britain's biggest exports.There is no doubt that the more football there is, the less chance it can be truly sustainable, until something significant changes. While it is obvious the football authorities clearly don't control the clubs' travel plans, it is equally obvious to state that the clubs do not control the schedules, so when does the circular argument break?To that end this research is intended to better inform a debate that, up until now, has too often focused on one team at a time and been anecdotal, a cycle from which many think it is impossible to see progress. That includes acknowledging the relatively small emissions we are talking about but at the same time giving credence to what Vince called an ""example"" and others call an ""opportunity"" for the power and influence of football to be put to immense positive effect.Sport has a long track record of bringing wider societal issues to the fore, and football has a more powerful role in that than any sport. A conversation about this domestic flight issue in the world of sport brings in discussion about the state of public transport in the UK, and the present and future of air travel.Why do we not hear the biggest names in football speaking up on environmental issues to big audiences like they do on other issues? Is it because we haven't been able to progress the conversation in football? Is it because the emissions are not as apparent as other sports?It might make sense for Formula 1 drivers to be quiet on environmental issues and yet we have Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg all speaking up. Where is football's 'world champion'?*BBC Sport has had a Sustainability Strategy in place since 2021 which includes a no domestic flight policy.

climate,"What is climate change? A really simple guidePublished17 MarchShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsOur Planet NowImage source, Getty ImagesWorld temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, rising sea levels and mass extinction of species. The world faces a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.What is climate change?Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. However, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by then. A 2021 report by the independent Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.If nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels, and the irreversible loss of plant and animal species. What are the impacts of climate change?Extreme weather events are already more intense across the globe, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. East Africa just saw its fifth season of failed rains, which the UN's World Food Programme says has put up to 22 million people at risk of severe hunger.Extreme temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires - as seen in Europe last summer. France and Germany recorded about seven times more land burnt between January and the middle of July 2022, compared with the average.Hotter temperatures also mean that previously frozen ground will melt in places like Siberia, releasing greenhouse gases trapped for centuries into the atmosphere, further worsening climate change.In other regions, extreme rainfall caused historic flooding last year - as seen in China, Pakistan and Nigeria.People living in developing countries are expected to suffer the most as they have fewer resources to adapt to climate change. But there is frustration from these nations as they have produced the least greenhouse gas emissions.The planet's oceans and its habitats are also under threat. Research published in April 2022, funded by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, suggests that between 10% and 15% of marine species are already at risk of extinction.In a warmer world, land animals will also find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken.

What was agreed at COP27?Five key climate takeaways from COP27Climate costs deal struck but no fossil fuel progressMany countries have pledged to get to ""net zero"" by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that this is still achievable, but requires governments, businesses and individuals to make substantial changes now.What can individuals do?Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:take fewer flightslive car-free or use an electric carreduce consumption of meat and dairy productsreduce your energy usebuy energy efficient products, such as washing machines, when they need replacingimprove your home insulationswitch from a gas heating system to an electric heat pumpTop image from Getty Images.

Here are some things you can do to reduce your personal impact.1. Insulate your homeFrom installing a heat pump to turning down the heating, there is a raft of changes around the home that can help the planet. ""Switching from a gas or oil-powered heating system to an electric heat pump makes a considerable difference,"" according to Dr Neil Jennings, an academic from Imperial College London. ""On a day-to-day basis, switching off lights and appliances when not in use can help us to save money while reducing our impact on climate change.""The UK government currently offers grants of £5,000 for the installation of heat pumps in England and Wales.

This involves blocking up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out, such as around windows, doors or skirting boards. The EST estimates that draught-proofing could save £125 a year on average household bills.How can better insulation cut energy bills?Switching to a green energy provider or a green tariff can significantly reduce your household's carbon footprint. But a recent increase in wholesale energy prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means many providers have withdrawn their offers.How to save energy at home and help the planet2. Cut out food waste and cut down on red meatLivestock creates 14% of all greenhouse gases globally, with cattle being by far the largest contributor. The simplest and most effective way to limit your impact is to reduce meat and dairy in your diet, particularly red meat such as lamb and beef.Good news for vegans, obviously - but there are other considerations to take into account.It's not just a question of ""tagging individual products as good or bad"", says biologist Prof Margaret Gill of the University of Aberdeen. She says the carbon footprint of any given food also depends on how it is produced, where it comes from and whether it's in season.Dr Jonathan Foley, who investigates climate change solutions, says you can save money and reduce waste by making smaller portions and saving leftovers for later at home.The world wastes between 25% and 30% of its food, according to the Waste & Resources Action Programme. Between 8-10% of global carbon emissions are linked to unconsumed produce, according to a UN report.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Climate Basics: CO2 explained3. Drive less, fly lessTransport is responsible for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions.Living car-free might be ""the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our transport emissions,"" according to Dr Jennings. However, ditching the car is not possible for everyone, particularly if you live in an area without good public transport or are disabled.Small steps still have an impact, like walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours. Electric cars are becoming more widespread, but they are still prohibitively expensive for some people and charging infrastructure is limited in places. Unfortunately for keen travellers, flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things we can do as individuals.Domestic flights have the largest emissions per person per kilometre. Train journeys can have less than a fifth of the impact of a domestic flight, although they might be more expensive. Booking in advance can help reduce the cost.""For those who fly a lot, reducing the number of flights you take will make a considerable difference to your personal footprint,"" says Dr Jennings.Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype?4.

You could also try buying second-hand.Choosing the right household appliances can also have a positive effect on your carbon footprint.

climate,"Carbon capture: What is it and how does it fight climate change?Published19 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsClimate changeImage source, InphoBy Jonah FisherBBC Environment CorrespondentThe UK government has announced that the first sites in the UK to capture greenhouse gases will be in Teesside. The carbon capture plants are designed to prevent carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial processes and power stations being released into the atmosphere.The announcement was part of the government's new Net Zero Strategy and aims to move the UK closer to meeting its legally-binding carbon commitments.  New UK plan to reach net zero goal faces criticismIs the UK on track to meet its climate targets?How does carbon capture work?Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits CO2, which is the main driver of climate change. The carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground.The UK government wants a new power station where carbon dioxide is captured and stored under the North Sea - either in old oil and gas reservoirs, or permeable rocks known as saline aquifers.Why is carbon capture needed?Carbon capture power plants are part of the government's commitment to remove carbon from UK electricity production by 2035. It hopes to build at least one by the mid 2020s, although that deadline now looks improbable. There has been a big expansion in renewable energy in the last decade - in particular the use of offshore wind - but the unresolved question is how to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing. Carbon capture power stations are seen as part of the solution, along with the increased use of nuclear energy, and other rapidly-evolving technologies such as hydrogen. A really simple guide to climate change  Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets?Where will the new power station be built?The government has now agreed to go ahead with funding three carbon capture plants near Redcar on Teesside. One will capture carbon from a gas-fired power station and the two others from hydrogen production. All would require the construction of a pipeline to transport the captured CO2 under the North Sea for storage. How much CO2 will these plants remove?In 2021, the UK emitted 425 million tonnes of CO2. That's fallen by almost 50% since 1990. The amount being captured at these proposed power stations is very small by comparison. None of the proposed carbon capture plants claims to capture more than two million tonnes a year. The government has set a target to capture between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030. That could involve other industrial processes as well as power generation. How much will carbon capture cost?The technology has been around for decades. It's mainly been used in industries where captured CO2 can be reused, for example to force out oil and gas from underground reserves. There are no such plans to use the CO2 from the new proposed power stations. The cost of a new gas power station, providing electricity for nearly a million homes, is around £350m.Catherine Raw of energy company SSE told the BBC that building a similar sized gas power station with carbon capture would roughly double the cost.The hope is that the price might fall over time. The cost of renewable energy for example has plummeted in the last decade.There are those who see carbon capture as too expensive and believe the money would be better spent on renewables and power storage (like batteries). ""These power stations look like another excuse for the government to show preference to their friends in the oil and gas industry, making energy more expensive to everyone else's disadvantage,"" says Dr Doug Parr of campaign group Greenpeace UK.  Do other countries have carbon capture?In September 2022 there were just 30 carbon capture facilities in the world, according to a report from the Global CCS Institute.Almost all of these are attached to industrial plants carrying out activities such as natural gas processing or fertiliser production.Once built, it is hoped other industries would use the UK power station's pipeline to store CO2 under the North Sea.  Image source, AlamyImage caption, Built in 2014, the Boundary Dam power station removes up to 90% of the CO2 it generatesThe only carbon capture power station currently operating is a coal-fired plant at Boundary Dam in western Canada. However, several carbon capture gas power stations similar to those proposed in the UK are in development, mostly in the US.Related TopicsCarbon capture and storageGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergy industryClimate changeRenewable energyCarbon neutrality"
climate,"Guernsey's emissions lower than pre-pandemic - StatesPublished6 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, Transport is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases in Guernsey is transportBy John FernandezBBC Guernsey political reporterGuernsey's greenhouse gas emissions remain ""significantly lower"" than pre-pandemic levels, the States says.In the latest report on the island's total emissions, the States said 293.2 kilotons were emitted in 2021 - about 4.6 tonnes per person.The figure is slightly higher than the 292.5 kilotons emitted in 2020. Both years were affected by coronavirus.The biggest contributor to emissions in 2021 was transport, which made up about a third of the total, the data said.The report predicted emissions to rise to 336.1 kilotons in 2022.However, the States said the estimate was still significantly lower than the 447 kilotons emitted in 2019.'Right direction'Deputy Lindsay de Sausmarez, President of the Committee for the Environment and Infrastructure, said year-on-year reductions in emissions were being made. ""Our emissions from 2020 and 2021 were always going to be something of an anomaly with unprecedented reductions in transport and commercial energy use due to lockdowns,"" she said.""However, with the provisional estimate for 2022 below pre-Covid levels, the data suggest we are heading in the right direction.""She said efforts were under way to reduce emissions from transport by making the overall network more efficient.""It's so interlinked with housing so we do have a big focus on transport because we can't deliver the housing we need unless we also make our transport system more efficient,"" she said.Deputy de Sausmarez also credited a waste reduction strategy - which sees non-recyclable waste exported via the UK to Sweden to be incinerated and turned into energy - for emissions reductions.Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

This allows it to anticipate problems, and progress more smoothly through traffic.The system has been on trial on the roads of Woolwich, in south-east London, as part of the ServCity project which aims to refine autonomous technologies for busy city streets. The scheme, which has been operating for three years, is run by a consortium including Nissan, Hitachi Europe, the Transport Research Laboratory and the University of Nottingham, among others. It is now coming to an end. Image source, NissanImage caption, The Nissan Leaf is equipped with multiple sensorsThe project uses Nissan's electric Leaf model. Each car is festooned with cameras and sensors, many of them bolted to a perfectly ordinary roof rack. The boot is full of computers and electronics. It all looks rather rough and ready.But out on the road, following a circuit between roundabouts on the A206, it feels smooth and controlled. Sitting in the back seat, it's remarkably easy to forget the car is guiding itself.Such precision is helped by guidance systems using precise 3D mapping, highly accurate GPS, radar, and Lidar - a laser-based sensing method.Over the past three years, ServCity's cars have racked up some 1,600 miles of autonomous driving, without a serious incident - though on every outing a safety driver has been in position to take control if necessary.It is an impressive record. The roads of Woolwich are busy and unpredictable. Buses dice with taxis, delivery drivers stop without warning, and cyclists weave through heavy traffic.""What we're actually trying to do is expand the boundaries of autonomous drive,"" explains David Moss, Nissan's senior vice president for research and development in the UK and Europe. ""So we want to be able to improve not just the ability to drive on the highway, but also to take on complex environments in the city.""Trials of self-driving vehicles are nothing new. There are even commercial services using them as taxis, on a strictly controlled basis, in some cities in the US, China and South Korea.Image source, NissanImage caption, The ServCity car used information from roadside camerasThis project, however, has focused specifically on finding ways for the car to use roadside infrastructure, such as traffic cameras, to improve its awareness - and allow it to drive more smoothly.This is where the technology being overseen by James Long comes in. He is the head of technical consulting at the Smart Mobility Living Lab, which was set up with the help of government funding to create a test-bed for connected and self-driving technology in London.""What we've been looking at particularly is things like parked vehicles and buses in bus stops that are beyond the line of sight,"" he says.""So we've been using our roadside cameras and infrastructure to be able to see those situations - a bit like X-ray vision - beyond the line of sight in such a way that the information can be transmitted to the vehicle.""Ultimately, this kind of technology could be used to build a kind of ecosystem in which cars do not rely on their own sensors, but take in a wide array of information from communicating with their surroundings, and indeed with one another.In theory, that should reduce congestion.Image source, NissanImage caption, Some experts say driverless cars will have to connect to road infrastructure""I really applaud this approach,"" says Sven Beiker, founder of the Silicon Valley Mobility consultancy, and a former head of the Center for Automotive research at Stanford University.""We need this connection between the automated, self-driving, autonomous vehicle and a centralised infrastructure and potentially to other vehicles as well.""I do not think you can have a self-driving car without some sort of connection to road infrastructure.""But although the ServCity trial is clearly impressive, Mr Beiker thinks it will be years before use of self-driving cars in cities becomes widespread, because of the need to prepare infrastructure and develop high-definition 3D maps in every area they are to be used. ""If you were to say to the operator [of this project], 'Hey, I love your service, can you get us a demo in Manchester tomorrow?', it would be impossible,"" he says.More technology of business:Crewless container ships appear on the horizon‘I left teaching to train as a heat pump engineer’Could waste plastic become a useful fuel source?The tiny diamond sphere central to a fusion breakthroughThe remote Swedish town leading the green steel raceMr Beiker says expanding such services will be an incremental process.""It almost goes on a street-by-street basis. It's not city-by-city. It's much more like, OK, you did this street, let's do the next street.""Nissan's David Moss agrees that it will be many years before fully autonomous cars become mainstream. However, he thinks some of the benefits of trials like ServCity will be seen sooner rather than later.""The final end result is a long way off,"" he says.""But some of what we've learned, we will progressively build into the cars going onto the roads today.""Related TopicsDriverless carsElectric cars"
business,"UK-Asia trade deal to boost UK economy by 0.08%Published2 hours agocommentsCommentsShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsBrexitImage source, Getty ImagesBy Tom EspinerBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe UK has signed a deal to join a trade pact with 11 Asia and Pacific nations, three years after it officially left the European Union.Joining the group will boost UK exports by cutting tariffs on goods such as cheese, cars, chocolate, machinery, gin and whisky, the government said.However, the government's own estimates show being in the bloc will only add 0.08% to the size of the UK's economy.The trade area covers a market of around 500 million people.The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership - or CPTPP - was established in 2018, and includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.Membership of the CPTPP loosens restrictions on trade between members and reduce tariffs - a form of border tax - on goods.UK to join Asia's trade club - what is the CPTPP?Together, the 11 members account for about 13% of the world's income and after 21 months of negotiations, the UK has become the first European country to join.The government said the agreement was the UK's ""biggest trade deal since Brexit"". However, the gains for the UK from joining are expected to be modest. The UK already has free trade deals with all of the members except Brunei and Malaysia, some of which were rolled over from its previous membership of the EU.And even with some gains in trading the government only estimates it will add 0.08% to the size of the economy in 10 years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides forecasts for the government, has previously said Brexit would reduce the UK's potential economic growth by about 4% in the long term.'Prime position'But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal demonstrated the ""real economic benefits of our post-Brexit freedoms"".""As part of CPTPP, the UK is now in a prime position in the global economy to seize opportunities for new jobs, growth and innovation,"" he said.""British businesses will now enjoy unparalleled access to markets from Europe to the south Pacific.""Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said the agreement was like ""buying a start-up"".""This is not to replace EU trade, this is in addition. We are still in a free trade agreement with the EU,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme.""You wouldn't buy a small company like that and expect it to be delivering on the day - we are thinking about the potential,"" she said, adding that in seven years ""40% of the world's middle class is going to come from that region"".Ms Badenoch denied there would be any hit to UK agriculture, saying the deal would ""create new markets"" for farmers.Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the UK joining the CPTPP was ""encouraging"", but added that questions remain on ""consumer safety, food safety, data protection and environmental protections"".The government said other ""benefits"" of being in the bloc included, a boost to the services sector, by UK firms not being required to establish a local office or be resident to supply a service, meaning they will be on a par with local firms.

business,"Why is the UK economy lagging behind the US, Germany and others?Published18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsBrexitImage source, Getty ImagesBy Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe UK economy is struggling - and people are feeling it in their pockets, as wages fail to keep up with rising prices.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK economy will shrink this year while every other major economy will grow. The Bank of England also forecasts a recession in the UK in 2023 - albeit one that is shorter and less severe than previously forecast.Perhaps it's not surprising the outlook is bleak given the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and soaring costs of both energy and food.But why is the UK seemingly faring worse than other rich countries such as the US, Germany and France?Is the UK really lagging behind?Forecasts are never perfect. There are so many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather - that, inevitably, predictions often miss the mark. But they can point in the right direction.And the existing evidence shows other countries have taken less of a hit from the huge challenges of recent years than the UK has.Figures from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which looks at how rich countries are performing, show the UK economy fell further than others in the first months of the pandemic. The UK's pace of recovery was fast once the economy reopened - but not fast enough to make up the lost ground. But the difference between the UK and others may not be quite as big as it appears.That's because most countries measure the output of their public services, such as health and education, based on the costs - a nurse's wage, for example. In the UK they are accounted for differently, by valuing the services delivered - such as operations in hospital.As a result, the UK's figures better reflect the impact of closed schools and cancelled operations during Covid, as well as disruption due to strikes.The bigger picture, however, remains: the Bank of England and the IMF both expect the UK economy to shrink this year, while other G7 countries are expected to grow.Some observers, including pro-Brexit economist Julian Jessop, believe the IMF was overly gloomy about the UK's prospects and that the differences under discussion - a percentage point here or there - are small.Nevertheless, he says, there is still definitely ""something to explain"" about the UK's flagging economic performance.Is it all down to Brexit?Estimates about the cost of Brexit vary - according to a report by Bloomberg it is costing the UK economy roughly £100bn a year, and the economy is 4% smaller than it might have been if the UK had stayed in the EU.""The EU is a very rich part of the world,"" says Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think tank. ""And we've chosen, for better or worse, to make trade with that grouping of countries a lot more difficult, so it's clearly going to be something that makes it harder for the UK economy to grow.""What impact has Brexit had on the UK economy?Business investment has stagnated since the referendum vote in 2016 too, he says - another ""drag on growth"". A Bank of England policymaker has said that Brexit hit UK investment to the tune of £29bn.EU workers used to come freely to work in the UK but can no longer do so, making it hard for the hospitality, agriculture, and care sectors to find enough staff. Julian Jessop is a fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs and describes himself as a ""Brexit optimist"". He believes there are big potential gains from leaving the EU, but agrees there have been short-term economic costs.""We're still in a sort of transition phase, where the negatives are dominating,"" he says. But he says those negatives are ""smaller than people have been arguing"" and ""more likely to be temporary, because a lot of them have to do with uncertainty and the process of adjustment"".What else is affecting the economy?Energy costs Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent global energy prices soaring - but the impact varies between countries.The US has its own domestic sources of fossil fuels and some European countries have more alternative sources of energy, Mr Emmerson says. France, for example, has a large nuclear network, and Norway has significant hydropower. ""Britain is pretty exposed,"" he says.Moreover, the way the UK prices electricity is based on the cost of gas, the most expensive form of electricity generation. That has pushed up bills across the economy and made inflation worse, Mr Jessop says.Workforce shortagesMost economies saw their workforce shrink during the pandemic.But again, the UK is an outlier, with numbers failing to bounce back after the crisis. Economists are still trying to work out why. It seems it is not just down to having fewer EU workers. Young people have opted to study rather than work, older people have retired early, and more people are receiving long-term sickness benefits. Who are the millions of Britons not working?More 16-24-year-olds get jobs as living costs biteThere are signs the workforce is starting to grow again, which could help boost growth and tax revenues later this year.Long-term problemsThere are also more fundamental reasons behind the UK's weaker performance, suggests Cambridge University economist Diane Coyle.While the economy has slowed since the financial crisis in 2008, the roots of the problems go back much further, she argues, with investment in decline since the 1990s.That left the economy lacking the resilience to cope with the triple shocks of Covid, Brexit and the war in Ukraine.""That's down to the long-term weaknesses, long-term under investment, in the private and the public sector, [and] degradation of public services and infrastructure, which are just essential if the economy is going to grow,"" she says.For its part, the government says the UK economy is resilient. Responding to figures showing that the UK narrowly avoided a recession in 2022, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the numbers showed ""underlying resilience"" - but added the country was ""not out of the woods"".Related TopicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsEconomic growthBrexitMore on this storyUK not out of woods as it avoids recession - Hunt10 FebruaryWhat impact has Brexit had on the UK economy?31 JanuaryMore 16-24-year-olds get jobs as living costs bite14 FebruaryWho are the millions of Britons not working?15 MarchHow much should we care what the IMF thinks?31 JanuaryWhat is GDP and how does it affect me?3 hours ago"

She is a close friend of former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Ms Robison was responsible for introducing the controversial gender reforms in her previous role as social justice secretary.The announcement came as Mr Yousaf unveiled his new cabinet team after being formally sworn as first minister in a brief ceremony at the Court of Session.Kate Forbes to leave Scottish governmentShona Robison to be Scottish deputy first ministerOther key appointments include Michael Matheson taking over from Mr Yousaf as health secretary, while former transport minister Jenny Gilruth will join the full cabinet for the first time as education secretary.Another cabinet newcomer, Mairi McAllan, will be the net zero and just transition secretary, at the age of just 30.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The new cabinet team consists of six women and three menAnd Neil Gray, who led Mr Yousaf's SNP leadership campaign, also joins the cabinet after being given responsibility for the wellbeing economy, fair work and energy briefs.The SNP's deputy leader, Keith Brown, has been replaced by Angela Constance as the country's justice secretary. The remaining three members of the nine-strong cabinet team are:Mairi Gougeon, who remains the rural affairs secretaryAngus Robertson, who is still the secretary for the constitution, external affairs and cultureShirley-Anne Somerville, who becomes cabinet secretary for social justiceThe full list of 18 non-cabinet ministerial roles was also announced on Wednesday, including a new post of minister for independence, which will be filled by Jamie Hepburn. The co-leaders of the Scottish Greens Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater have been reappointed to the roles they held under Nicola Sturgeon as part of the partnership agreement with the SNP.There is no role in Humza Yousaf's government for defeated SNP leadership candidate Ash Regan. Kate Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in the contest, announced on Tuesday she was leaving the government. She had been offered a new role by Mr Yousaf that would have given her Ms Gougeon's rural affairs job rather than finance - which would generally be viewed as a demotion - but she turned it down.The new cabinet team has five members under the age of 40 and, for the first time, a majority of women.Mr Yousaf said it reflected the priorities that the government will pursue, including tackling child poverty, improving public services and building a fairer, greener economy.He added: ""I have committed myself to a radical, ambitious and progressive policy agenda for Scotland - and I know that this team is the right one to deliver it.""As we make the case for Scottish independence, we will continue to govern well and demonstrate to the people of Scotland the benefits of decisions about their lives being taken here in Scotland.""Mr Yousaf said he wanted a government that looked as much as possible like the people it represented, but insisted that all of his appointments had been made on merit. He also paid tribute to those ministers who are now departing government - including Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney.And he said he was disappointed that Ms Forbes was not in his cabinet as ""she's a great talent, she's somebody who has got a lot to give"".Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Mairi McAllan joins the cabinet for the first time, at the age of 30During the SNP leadership campaign, Mr Yousaf said he favoured a ""big tent"" rather than ""inner circle"" approach to making key decisions and has pledged to bring the party back together again after deep divisions were exposed by the contest.He faced withering criticism of his own ministerial record from Ms Forbes in a live STV debate, while her views on issues such as gender recognition reform and gay marriage led the Scottish Greens to question whether they could work with her.Given the narrow margin of his victory over Ms Forbes, by 52.1% to 47.9%, some of her supporters had urged Mr Yousaf to keep her in government.  BBC Scotland understands that Ms Forbes felt the SNP's partnership agreement with the Scottish Greens would have ""tied her hands and cost her dearly in her constituency"" if she had taken the rural affairs job.It emerged earlier on Wednesday that Ivan McKee, who had been the business minister under Nicola Sturgeon, will also leave the government after being offered a new role that he regarded as a demotion. Mr McKee had initially been campaign manager for Ms Forbes in the leadership contest, but stepped back from that role after early controversies in her campaign.Humza Yousaf has opted for a balance of youth and experience in his cabinet.This is underlined by the way he has split the finance portfolio between his deputy Shona Robison - an MSP since 1999 and a veteran of several government posts - and a fresher face in Neil Gray, who takes on the economy brief.Angela Constance and Michael Matheson both know their way around government, and have been handed two of the trickier jobs in justice and health.But perhaps the stiffest task has been reserved for cabinet newbie Jenny Gilruth, the former teacher who must now attempt to close the attainment gap - a task which eluded a succession of education secretaries including John Swinney.There are one or two glaring absences though.Keith Brown is out as justice secretary, two years after returning to government. He will presumably go back to focusing on his post as deputy leader of the SNP, with big changes in the offing at party HQ.And the absence of Kate Forbes may make it harder for Mr Yousaf to pull the party back together, given how close she ran him in the leadership contest.Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie described the new cabinet team as ""dismal"" and said it ""cements the SNP's new status as a deeply divided party led by B-rate politicians"".She added: ""The first minister promised to bring the country together, but he can't even bring his own party together. Loyalty is being rewarded over talent - but both are in short supply in the SNP. ""At the heart of this continuity government are some of the most incompetent politicians of the last decade, set to deliver more of the same failure.""Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: ""This is a cabinet in Humza Yousaf's image - failed, continuity ministers appointed by a failed, continuity minister. ""The likes of Shona Robison, Michael Matheson, Angela Constance and Jenny Gilruth have been found sorely wanting in previous ministerial roles, yet all have been 'rewarded' with promotion by the new first minister.""Related TopicsScottish governmentSNP leadership contest 2023SNP (Scottish National Party)Humza Yousaf"
technology,"Why you may have a thinking digital twin within a decadePublished13 June 2022Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some experts say that thinking digital twins of humans may be just a decade awayBy Jane WakefieldTechnology reporterMost of us have been told by a friend that we have a doppelganger - some stranger they passed on the street who bore an uncanny resemblance to you.But imagine if you could create your very own twin, an exact copy of yourself, but one that lived a purely digital life?We are living in an age where everything that exists in the real world is being replicated digitally - our cities, our cars, our homes, and even ourselves.And just like the hugely-hyped metaverse - plans for a virtual, digital world where an avatar of yourself would walk around  - digital twins have become a new, talked-about tech trend.A digital twin is an exact replica of something in the physical world, but with a unique mission - to help improve, or in some other way provide feedback to, the real-life version.Initially such twins were just sophisticated 3D computer models, but artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the internet of things - which uses sensors to connect physical things to the network - have meant that you can now build something digitally that is constantly learning from and helping improve the real counterpart.Technology analyst Rob Enderle believes that we will have the first versions of thinking human digital twins ""before the end of the decade"".Image source, Intel Free PressImage caption, Rob Enderle says that there are ethical considerations to study as digital human twins are developed""The emergence of these will need a huge amount of thought and ethical consideration, because a thinking replica of ourselves could be incredibly useful to employers,"" he says.""What happens if your company creates a digital twin of you, and says 'hey, you've got this digital twin who we pay no salary to, so why are we still employing you?'?Mr Enderle thinks that ownership of such digital twins will become one of the defining questions of the impending metaverse era.We have already started the journey towards human twinning - in the form of the above mentioned avatars - but these are currently rather clunky and primitive. In Meta's (formerly Facebook) virtual reality platform, Horizon Worlds, for example, you may be able to give your avatar a similar face to your own, but you can't even provide it with any legs because the technology is at such early stages.Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, understands the appeal of creating digital twins of humans, ""it is reminiscent of exciting science fiction novels, and at the moment that is the stage where it is at"".Image source, Sandra WachterImage caption, Prof Wachter says that digital human twins remain just science fiction at this stageShe adds that whether someone will ""be successful at law school, get sick, or commit a crime - will depend on the still debated 'nature versus nurture question'. It will depend on good luck and bad luck, friends, family, their socio-economic background and environment, and of course their personal choices.""   However, she explains, AI is not yet good at predicting these ""single social events, due to their inherent complexity. And so, we have a long ways to go until we can understand and model a person's life from beginning to end, assuming that is ever possible.""Instead, it is in the fields of product design, distribution and urban planning where the use of digital twins is currently the most sophisticated and extensive.In Formula One racing, the McLaren and Red Bull teams use digital twins of their race cars. Meanwhile, delivery giant, DHL, is creating a digital map of its warehouse and supply chains to allow it to be more efficient.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, McLaren has a digital twin of its latest car, which was used to aid its developmentAnd increasingly our cities are being replicated in the digital world; Shanghai and Singapore both have digital twins, set up to help improve the design and operations of buildings, transport systems and streets.In Singapore, one of the tasks of its digital twin is to help find new ways for people to navigate, avoiding areas of pollution. Other places use the technology to suggest where to build new infrastructure such as underground lines. And new cities in the Middle East are being built simultaneously in the real world and the digital.French software company, Dassault Systemes, says it is now seeing interest from thousands of firms for its digital twins technology.So far its work has included using digital twins to help a hair care firm digitally design more sustainable shampoo bottles, instead of endless real-life prototyping. This cuts down on waste. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Authorities in Shanghai, pictured, have a digital twin of the city which they use to model its future developmentAnd it is enabling other firms to design new futuristic projects - from jetpacks, to motorbikes that have floating wheels, and even flying cars. Each has a physical prototype too, but the refining of that initial model happens in the digital space.But the real value seen in digital twins is in healthcare. Dassault Systemes' Living Heart project has created an accurate virtual model of the a human heart that can be tested and analysed, allowing surgeons to play out a series of ""what if"" scenarios for the organ, using various procedures and medical devices.The project was founded by Dr Steve Levine, who had personal reasons to want to create a digital twin. His daughter was born with congenital heart disease, and a few year's back, when she was in her late 20s and at high risk of heart failure, he decided to recreate her heart in virtual reality.Boston Children's Hospital is now using this technology to map out real patient heart conditions, while at Great Ormond Street hospital in London, a team of engineers is working with clinicians to test devices that may help children with rare and difficult-to-treat heart conditions.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Experimenting on a digital heart also has the knock-on effect of cutting down on the need to test on animals - one of the more controversial aspects of scientific research, says Severine Trouillet, global affairs director at Dassault Systemes.The firm now plans more digital organ twins, including the eye and even the brain.""At some point we will all have a digital twin, so that you can go to the doctor, and we can increasingly make preventative medicine, and make sure that every treatment is personalised,"" says Ms Trouillet.Perhaps even more ambitious than replicating human organs is the race to build a digital version of our entire planet.US software firm, Nvidia, runs a platform called Omniverse, designed to create virtual worlds and digital twins.One of its most ambitious projects is to build a digital doppelganger of the Earth, capturing high resolution imagery of its entire surface.Image source, NvidiaImage caption, A graphic illustration of Earth-2, which aims to help track and tackle climate changeEarth-2, as it is dubbed, will use a combination of deep-learning models and neural networks to mimic physical environments in the digital sphere, and come up with solutions to climate change.In March this year, the European Commission, in conjunction with the European Space Agency among others, announced its own plans to make a digital twin of the planet, dubbed Destination Earth.By the end of 2024, it hopes to have enough data from real-time observations and simulations to have a digital twin that will focus on floods, drought and heatwaves, alongside natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis, and provide countries with concrete plans to save lives in the face of these growing challenges.Related TopicsUrban planningArtificial intelligence"
technology,"UK rules out new AI regulatorPublished2 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Shiona McCallumTechnology reporterThe government has set out plans to regulate artificial intelligence with new guidelines on ""responsible use"".Describing it as one of the ""technologies of tomorrow"", the government said AI contributed £3.7bn ($5.6bn) to the UK economy last year.Critics fear the rapid growth of AI could threaten jobs or be used for malicious purposes.The term AI covers computer systems able to do tasks that would normally need human intelligence.This includes chatbots able to understand questions and respond with human-like answers, and systems capable of recognising objects in pictures.A new white paper from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposes rules for general purpose AI, which are systems that can be used for different purposes.Technologies include, for example, those which underpin chatbot ChatGPT.As AI continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people's privacy, their human rights or their safety. There is concern that AI can display biases against particular groups if trained on large datasets scraped from the internet which can include racist, sexist and other undesirable material. AI could also be used to create and spread misinformation.As a result many experts say AI needs regulation.However AI advocates say the tech is already delivering real social and economic benefits for people.And the government fears organisations may be held back from using AI to its full potential because a patchwork of legal regimes could cause confusion for businesses trying to comply with rules. Instead of giving responsibility for AI governance to a new single regulator, the government wants existing regulators - such as the Health and Safety Executive, Equality and Human Rights Commission and Competition and Markets Authority - to come up with their own approaches that suit the way AI is actually being used in their sectors.These regulators will be using existing laws rather than being given new powers.Michael Birtwistle, associate director from the Ada Lovelace Institute, carries out independent research, and said he welcomed the idea of regulation but warned about ""significant gaps"" in the UK's approach which could leave harms unaddressed. ""Initially, the proposals in the white paper will lack any statutory footing. This means no new legal obligations on regulators, developers or users of AI systems, with the prospect of only a minimal duty on regulators in future. ""The UK will also struggle to effectively regulate different uses of AI across sectors without substantial investment in its existing regulators,"" he said.The white paper outlines five principles that the regulators should consider to enable the safe and innovative use of AI in the industries they monitor:  • Safety, security and robustness: applications of AI should function in a secure, safe and robust way where risks are carefully managed• Transparency and ""explainability"": organisations developing and deploying AI should be able to communicate when and how it is used and explain a system's decision-making process in an appropriate level of detail that matches the risks posed by the use of AI• Fairness: AI should be used in a way which complies with the UK's existing laws, for example on equalities or data protection, and must not discriminate against individuals or create unfair commercial outcomes• Accountability and governance: measures are needed to ensure there is appropriate oversight of the way AI is being used and clear accountability for the outcomes • Contestability and redress: people need to have clear routes to dispute harmful outcomes or decisions generated by AIOver the next year, regulators will issue practical guidance to organisations to set out how to implement these principles in their sectors. Science, innovation and technology secretary Michelle Donelan said: ""Artificial intelligence is no longer the stuff of science fiction, and the pace of AI development is staggering, so we need to have rules to make sure it is developed safely.""But Simon Elliott, partner at law firm Dentons told the BBC the government's approach was a ""light-touch"" that makes the UK ""an outlier"" against the global trends around AI regulation.China, for example, has taken the lead in moving AI regulations past the proposal stage with rules that mandate companies notify users when an AI algorithm is playing a role.""Numerous countries globally are developing or passing specific laws to address perceived AI risks - including algorithmic rules passed in China or the USA,"" continued Mr Elliott. He warned about the concerns that consumer groups and privacy activists will have over the risks to society ""without detailed, unified regulation.""He is also worried that the UK's regulators could be burdened with ""an increasingly large and diverse"" range of complaints, when ""rapidly developing and challenging"" AI is added to their workloads. In the EU, the European Commission has published proposals for regulations titled the Artificial Intelligence Act which would have a much broader scope than China's enacted regulation.They include ""grading"" AI products according to how potentially harmful they might be and staggering regulation accordingly. So for example an email spam filter would be more lightly regulated than something designed to diagnose a medical conditions - and some AI uses, such as social grading by governments, would be prohibited altogether.""AI has been around for decades but has reached new capacities fuelled by computing power,"" Thierry Breton, the EU's Commissioner for Internal Market, said in a statement. The AI Act aims to ""strengthen Europe's position as a global hub of excellence in AI from the lab to the market, ensure that AI in Europe respects our values and rules, and harness the potential of AI for industrial use,"" Mr Breton added.Meanwhile in the US The Algorithmic Accountability Act 2022 requires companies to assess the impacts of AI but the nation's AI framework is so far voluntary.Related TopicsArtificial intelligenceMore on this storyAI could affect 300 million jobs - report2 days agoNew biometrics laws urgently needed, review finds29 June 2022ChatGPT-style tech brought to Microsoft 36516 MarchNew chatbot has everyone talking to it7 December 2022"
